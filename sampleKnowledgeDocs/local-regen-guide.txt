Foreword by Kevin Owocki
When I founded Gitcoin in 2017, being in web3 and valuing public goods,
regeneration, pro-social communities, or protopian communities was rare. It
was very lonely. The culture of technologists in web3 back in those days was
more focused on libertarian values or financial values.
With programmable money, we can now program our values into our money.
The design space for crypto is vast and also deep. We have a revolutionary
opportunity to build economic systems that mirror our values. We explore this
design space by building culture and by building smart contracts. Just as a
circuit is etched onto silicon, we etch smart contracts onto blockchains. We
practice culture by doing, sharing and learning. If we want regenerative
economics to be a thing, we must build it. We are the ones we’ve been waiting
for.
To kickstart this movement in Feb 2022, I published Greenpilled: How Crypto
Can Regenerate the world.
Since then, I’ve met thousands of individuals who share the vision of using
crypto to build positive sum games, protopian economic systems, regenerative
culture, and other novel paradigms. It is no longer so lonely to be building on
these themes. But still there is work to be done.
Greenpill is a vessel for that work. There are other great vessels too. But I will
focus here on Greenpill here, because that is the vessel we are co-creating
together.

The first version of Greenpill in 2022 was the book and the podcast. For the last
18 months, I’ve been producing the Greenpill podcast, a podcast dedicated to
regen web3. Thanks to the generous partnership of Bankless, we have an
audience between 2k-8k (depending on the episode) per episode. This has been a
great resource to create little pockets of common knowledge about technical
concepts like Cluster Mapping, coordination mechanisms, sybil resistence, but
also advance cultural movements like solarpunk, DAOs, network states, web3 in
the global source, etc. We’ve had industry luminaries like Vitalik Buterin, Karl
Floersch, Nadia Asparouhova, and others on the pod (sometimes multiple
times). I’ve done 155 episodes together, to see the different categories of podcasts
we’ve done checkout https://www.youtube.com/@Green_Pill_Podcast
In 2023, we launched Greenpill v2 AKA Greenpill.network, which using the
Greenpill podcast as an attractor, launched what we call a “CoordiNation across
Nations & Cultures. CoordiNation (noun): a network-society that exports
regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.”. We now have recruited Sejal
Rekhan as community manager/operational lead, and we have ~13 active
chapters in places as diverse as NYC, Denver, Nigeria, Turkey, China, India, and
more, who run local meetups and build momentum regenerating local
communities. My vision is that each local community member has the global
context of regen web3 & the mechanics/software that can be used AND ALSO
has the legitimacy/networks/relationships in the local community. This feels
like a very powerful combination for local bottoms up movement building.
Using this network, combining with Gitcoin’s tools, we could bootstrap a
network of better impact funding.

In 2024, we are building Greenpill v3 . Here are some themes and updates
about Greenpill v3:
1. We will be spinning the podcast out of Bankless at the end of October. I’m
super thankful to Bankless for getting us started, and I’m proud of the 150
eps we’ve done together. And very thankful they will be letting us take the
audience with us. I’ve hired an independent podcast editor to continue
producing/distributing the podcast, and plan to continue producing it
independently. But I don’t have the cycles to keep producing it 2x/week, so
I’m thinking about moving to dropping 5-10 episodes per quarter all at once,
allowing people to binge listen when they’re dropped.
2. I’ve been busy with my return to Gitcoin, and have been fairly absentee in
the Greenpill.network discord / community lately. I want to own this. I think
there is an opportunity for me to pass the torch to people who are stepping
up in the Greenpill.network community to lead the network. In doing so, we
will reinforce that the Greenpill.network architecture is not a hub and spoke
around me, but that is becomes a peer to peer mesh network of community
members that are supporting one another. (meta point: its cool that im
leaning in at Greenpill when leaning out at Gitcoin, and visa versa when I
lean in at Gitcoin I lean out at Greenpill.network. Both networks are ebbing
and flowing together )!

1.

3. To the end of elevating other members of the network, we’ve got some really
exciting opportunities for members of the Greenpill.network or Gitcoin who
want to step in.
There are many opportunities to join/lead local chapters. Checkout the
the Greenpill Discord ( https://discord.gg/greenpill ) to learn more
We’ll be running a Gitcoin rounds for Greenpill to fund what matters to
the Greenpill.network (including local chapters). Join #greenpill-qfround on the Greenpill Discord ( https://discord.gg/greenpill ) to learn
more.
We’ll be onboarding greenpill citizens to run QF rounds for Gitcoin. Join
#greenpill-v2-round-operators
on
the
Greenpill
Discord
(
https://discord.gg/ ) to learn more.
I’m considering decentralizing my podcast hosting duties, which will
allow us to produce interesting content from more corners of the regen
web3 ecosystem. And also take the burden of podcast production off of
me. Join #greenpill-decentralizing-podcast on the Greenpill Discord (
https://discord.gg/greenpill ) to learn more.
We’ll be writing “local regen guides” to cross pollinate regen
thinking/skills across chapters. The goal is to get these done before
ETHDenver 2024. Join #greenpill-local-regen-guides on the Greenpill
Discord ( https://discord.gg/greenpill ) to learn more.
Many thanks to Sejal, to the chpater leads, and to the active members of
the netework. You have each been helping with these transitions. If you
have cycles/skills/resources to help Greenpill out, say hi in the discord!

The Power of
Public Spaces:
A Place to Innovate,
Grow and Connect
0xzenodotus

1

Does your community have a public space?
A public space is the perfect way to 'regenerate in the open.' In full view of the
communities we cherish. Nothing speaks to a community more than shared
responsibility and accessibility.
Over the last few years, we planned, designed and opened a space for the public.
(Located within Village Square Mall in Calgary, Alberta.)
In most communities, there's a place that anyone can go to. Although, we don't
typically view our public areas as hot spots or places we want to be at any time.
Can that be changed?

What resources can we use to create better public
spaces?
Some ideas:
Devices: cheaper every year, and many can get repurposed
Digital Interactive Textbooks (DITs): updateable, crowdsourced
opensource— empowered with tech like the EVM & AI
Open-sourced materials & tools
P2P systems: best for direct-to-community approaches
Wireless networks
Mentorships, Tutoring & Coaching
Career Advancement Opportunities

&

If we create places where people from all walks of life congregate, interact, share
ideas, and collaborate, then the power of socialization will spark new ideas
within our neighbourhoods.
Locally, we can make the largest impact. Direct to the community is not very
different than loving thy neighbour.
2

My Neighbourhood Has a Community Center:
Why Do We Need Better Public Spaces?
Often enough, we only consider the value of a public area once its sanctity gets
contested. After a contentious suggestion like rezoning nature preserves or after
a real estate developer converts an open space to a high-rise apartment building
without considering the perspectives of the residents of a community.
We mindlessly give up our rights all too often because of our fast-paced daily
lives, the hustle and bustle. The constant grind is an exceptionally dense
blindfold.
Have you had to stand in the queue at a government office? Another good
example of the rigidity we find ourselves in. How can this be so consistent across
the world?
Certainly, we can't all put the same effort into organizing ourselves. Or do we? Is
it that obvious?
Is it a mass coincidence that we increasingly find ourselves stuck further as a
global unit into debts and degenerative practices? It's as if we wish or hope for a
sustainable and regenerative force to fly in and sweep up the mess before us.
The bystander effect is not limited to people and crimes but people and inaction
— the thought that another person will handle this: leading to the unpleasant
result of nothing.

How do we define a public space?
We must tread this line of thinking more; there are important questions to
consider when evaluating your community's options and what is available for
the general public.

3

These are some good questions to ask yourself:
How often do you help areas in your community that are for the public?
Do you take advantage of the public spaces in your area?
Do you help maintain the local park?
How often do you visit the community center?
Have you ever rented out a public space for an event?
Have you recently seen your local library?
Have you noticed if the staff encourages growth & introduces new topics?
Are the patrons engaged in these spaces?
If you answer negatively to more than half of these questions, consider
championing a new public space for your community.
A decentralized agora is a town hall— more or less. Different areas will require
distinct approaches and unique models: ways to adapt instead of encroach.
Investing in our communities through community-run town halls can provide a
valuable space for people to connect. It will take some sacrifice and earnest
work: but it is attainable.
If you can keep coming up with more 'negatives' or 'bads,' then it may be time to
explore championing a valuable public space for your community: especially if
you can conceptualize how to do it better.
We set out to establish a 'public space' not owned and supported by a political
group: strictly, it's for the community, and the community keeps it alive. A
public space is often associated with parks, libraries, and squares. But we can
view this differently.
Public Goods are expensive when the cost doesn't get properly distributed.
Having bootstrapped and self-funded a public space for the last three years, I
can attest to the expense.
4

How can individuals distribute the cost of creating
public spaces?
Some typical expenses:
Leases: depends on location, negotiation skills and the overall market
Utilities: electricity, gas, wifi etc.
Office Furnishings: we took advantage of used office furniture; you can
likely do the same! Search for commercial office movers, thrift stores or
companies that resell office furniture.
Fees: Insurance, permits and business licencing (good chance you'll need to
form a corporation of some type)
Salaries: If you can't get volunteers or if insurance doesn't permit, you may
need to account for people to staff the space.
Some ways to distribute the cost:
Grants, donations, fundraising & crowdsourcing with set goals
Blockchains: The EVM is incredibly promising for the transparent funding
and maintenance of public goods
Quadratic Funding
Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)
Collective Memberships: With member fees similar to a COOP
Sponsorships & Partnerships: Alignment/brand collaboration to
strengthen both public goods and the orgs that build public-facing
goods/services
Fractionalized Responsibility: Distributing costs equally across a set of
addresses via NFTs like Hypercerts — cost share is split at the sale and paid
in full or with funds that stream on a set basis

5

How do we ensure that contributions are creating an
impact?
One way is that the legal system works in our favour; some issues may exist, but
distributed ownership and responsibility blend real-life credit/reputation and
on-chain history.
Real world public good agreements aka RWPGA
A fixed lease is a legal contract and must get paid. It would be best to replicate
the agreement or strictly put the contract on chain with the same terms minus
identifiable details. (Depending on confidentiality)
With contracts, whether on-chain or not, there is no arguing that the terms
outlined in a contract facilitates a base layer of honesty for both parties to
commit to. A contract also creates a due process, allowing people to navigate and
understand the conditions they must maintain, making it easier if anything bad
happens, and enforcing accountability.
And notoriously, this is abused because businesses need a mailing address. Fake
companies have been the main argument for popular short-sellers of large
companies for decades. After realizing there is only a little to prevent a company
from faking productivity values. And when people rarely visit factories they
invest in, it's way easier to get away with fraud.
However, with a transparent money chain, it becomes much easier to audit the
trail— especially if the company is fraudulent or the space doesn't exist.
With our ability to meet people or reach out virtually, we can also conduct popin visits, where someone locally attests that they went to the public space and
signs a transaction with their wallet, posts a photo on social media or some other
verifiable method.

6

Anything is possible if we cooperate in funding real-world public goods that
interface directly with our local communities while holding each other
accountable with verifiable proofs.

A Public Goods Cooperative: The Regen Republic
The concept of a PGC evolves with modern tech, encompassing areas designed to
inspire collaboration and facilitate the exchange of ideas and knowledge. And,
importantly, it doesn't need to be shouldered by individuals; we can distribute
that cost.
What it looks like when a cooperative funds public spaces in the real world:

A Public Goods Cooperative

7

We get a brilliant way to sustain public goods while also providing a way to hold
organizations or persons accountable. The best part is that we can look deeper
into the financials of organizations— institutions meant to support and
maintain the development of public goods are often unclear in how they use
their resources. This current opaque nature of public institutions must change if
we want public goods instead of public bads.
At any time, anyone can help make the budget more efficient, account for
expenses or suggest new ways to use capital! Anytime the cooperative can save
funds, it gets put back toward public goods, reinforcing them and adding
resilience and, in turn, sustainability.
Humans are unique in that we can sense when things are not sustainable, but it's
not easy to determine why or how to avoid the consequences of inaction or
overreaction.
People are not upset about paying an environmental deposit for bags;
they are mad that they keep purchasing reusable bags and forgetting
them.
We realize as a collective that changing bags didn't help; it's unsustainable still.
We didn't approach the learned behaviour with an attempt to change it; we went
for a fast solution with the most obvious results.
It would be a shame if we forgot about the importance of public spaces and then
desperately need them.
A modern public space entails more than a place to study, relax, or read.
With the abundance of resources available today, we can create highly advanced
areas packed with information and tools for the public.
In ancient Greece, the Agoras were central public hubs where people gathered,
built in the open and shared ideas.
8

Today, we can support decentralized Agoras that serve as real-life hubs for
innovation and growth, fostering an ecosystem that promotes learning,
collaboration, transparency and cooperation.
After thousands of years, it's obvious that we as humans align the most with a belief
system, and the stronger the belief system, the more powerful the community.
We can incentivize positive behaviour and encourage optimistic belief systems for
the world's benefit instead of harm— establishing sustainable loops instead of
degenerative leaks.

Public Space as a
Public Good

How We View Public Goods Today
A public good can be a thing that is freely available and in use by a person while
others can still use it— or there is room to grow and accompany additional
people. Non-rivalrous and non-excludable is the traditional definition.
Allowing someone into the library doesn't mean there are no more books or
fewer spaces or that the books themselves are not still valuable for the words
written inside. They'll get brought back, and everyone can check them out.
There is little competition for a public library and thus no rivalry because there
will always be people who want to read and ones who need to read.
For competition's sake, does that mean there is no incentive to improve some of
these public goods? Because we define them as non-rivalrous, inherently, the
standard is the accepted norm, and there are minimal reasons to improve—
especially without active suggestions.
These public goods include libraries, pools, skating rinks, pathways etc.
Ways a cooperative can foster positive-sum outcomes:
Productivity measurements: KPIs that underpin positive impacts.
Balanced practices that regenerate versus degenerate.
Focusing on sustainability and long-tail economic benefits.
Sharing Resources to promote mutually beneficial outcomes.
Use sustainable & enviro-conscious practices in operations.
Support local economies via insourcing goods/services.
Provide affordable and accessible goods/services to members &
communities.
Invest in education and training to empower members and strengthen the
cooperative and the community they represent.

11

How We View Public Goods Today

Saying I'm a regen instead of degen is easy, but what does it look like?
Determining if something is good for the public can be challenging. Actions
speak louder than words, but it's easier to suggest that something is regenerative
before later finding out it isn't.
It will take steady hands and careful eyes to watch and value public goods; we
need stewards that take care of goods and services for the public— ones that can
also measure and determine whether or not a public good as it stands is serving
the interest of the public or a few select members.
There are a few ways to tackle sustainability, but how do we know what is a
public good and what is a public bad?
If anyone can access something without restrictions above their control, it
could be a public good.
With newer technologies, particularly the internet, blockchains and networks, it
is now possible to establish community spaces that effectively cater to the needs
of the public without compromising their interests.
By leveraging cooperative games that are mutually beneficial, we can foster
positive behaviours and cultivate a collaborative spirit that encourages people to
work together towards a common goal.
When we unite and act together, voices can get heard; if we only think together,
we'll stay paralyzed by analysis. A consensus bias.
Something I heard long ago that sticks with me:
"If everyone thinks the same thing is right, then someone is very wrong."

12

The Public Expense of Privatizing Resources
When a resource is always available, and no one can claim profit over it in
abundance and without recourse, it could be a public good.
Examples of public amenities/resources:
Air quality monitoring
Community centers
Parks, Green spaces & Forests
Lakes & Rivers
Beaches & Campgrounds
Roads & Bridges
Weather data tracking
Globally, governments maintain many public goods because of a perceived
failure of coordination and fair allocation. We've struggled as a collective to
fairly govern our public goods for the interest of the collective instead of
privatized industries exploiting the resources for profit.
A problem we face with our public goods is the inherent management by
governments with ideological motives. And corporate entities that seek to
maximize shareholder and commercial value. The sheer size of our industries
today. They've grown so large that separate departments get used to manage
different industries, often leading to conflicting internal affairs and views.
An excerpt from newswire regarding fishery closures;
"The Coalition is requesting that the federal Fisheries Minister immediately
meet with commercial fishing organizations, to transparently share the
science behind the radical decision and to consider a delay in the closures so
that the fishery can be managed in an orderly manner that respects
sustainability."

13

How can individuals distribute the cost of creating
public spaces?
Some typical expenses:
Leases: depends on location, negotiation skills and the overall market
Utilities: electricity, gas, wifi etc.
Office Furnishings: we took advantage of used office furniture; you can
likely do the same! Search for commercial office movers, thrift stores or
companies that resell office furniture.
Fees: Insurance, permits and business licencing (good chance you'll need to
form a corporation of some type)
Salaries: If you can't get volunteers or if insurance doesn't permit, you may
need to account for people to staff the space.
Some ways to distribute the cost:
Grants, donations, fundraising & crowdsourcing with set goals
Blockchains: The EVM is incredibly promising for the transparent funding
and maintenance of public goods
Quadratic Funding
Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)
Collective Memberships: With member fees similar to a COOP
Sponsorships & Partnerships: Alignment/brand collaboration to
strengthen both public goods and the orgs that build public-facing
goods/services
Fractionalized Responsibility: Distributing costs equally across a set of
addresses via NFTs like Hypercerts — cost share is split at the sale and paid
in full or with funds that stream on a set basis
Large industries that grow in places like public waters can lead to either
mismanagement, negligence or otherwise inefficient distribution of public
resources. Especially with technology, the bureaucracy of a governmental body
may prevent it from being up to date on the newest standards, which can allow
for resource exploitation against the benefit of the public.
14

A Recent Tragedy of the Commons
The Canadian Maritimes suffered from overfishing and mismanaged resources
— recently and during the past.
During the 90s, technological advancements like sonar, trawlers and
underwater location devices allowed commercial fishermen to increase catch
rates and abuse natural resources. An over-competitive atmosphere ran unchecked, and the industry collapsed.
Many parties will support different types of public goods and spend more time
on areas and resources defined as beneficial to the public, depending on the
value they produce and if they are within the ideological frame.
Governments often make decisions that are unilateral regarding industries.
Which affects a wide range of people and can have unknown impacts.
When there is more information or input from everyone involved, making fair
decisions that benefit everyone can be easier. However, there are frequent time
restraints, and extensive research is not permitted— especially when decisions
must be made quickly to save resources and lives.
"In 1992, Northern Cod populations fell to one percent of historical levels, due
in large part to decades of overfishing. Prompting the Canadian Ministry of
Fisheries and Oceans to close the fishery, thus eliminating a traditional
livelihood for about 30,000 people. Three decades later, the fishery still has
not recovered.
Due to these market failures, the government has a special role in conserving
and managing public goods...Indeed, this explains why goods such as bridges,
parks, police protection, and fire departments are usually financed with tax
revenues that governments collect. Government serves as a coordinating
mechanism that provides public goods for the benefit of society."
- The Atmosphere as a Global Public Good by: Patrick A. Parenteau 15

We are far from well-coordinated and sustainable goods for the public benefit.
Even with an overarching manager and distributed funding via taxes. Our
governments need help coordinating at a mass scale and with the interests of the
parties involved. We can help with incentive structures and systems that work
for the benefit of society as a collective.
Technology will allow us to make public spaces sustainable and regenerative for
all— and many generations to come.

A Public Goods Cooperative: The Regen Republic
Have we truly considered the importance of interaction and connectivity in
public spaces?
Thanks to the ever-increasing number of network devices, the Internet of Things
(IoT) grants prolific access to open tools and accessible resources that help us
develop better public facilities.
However, it's worth questioning— are we treating public goods with the same
care and significance as before?
As a collective, we've demonstrated our collaborative ability throughout history.
Common areas present opportunities for the development of goods and services
that can greatly enhance the quality of life for the general public. All major
societies revered and protected their public areas. Neglecting them meant a less
enjoyable life for everyone overall.
Before overwhelming corruption, greed and overall neglect. Our structures and
values were powerful at creating impact. We've created magnificent spaces that
span regions, changing our perception of our environment forever.

16

A few times we've changed the world as a collective:
Golden Ages: Classic Societies
The Renaissance
Industrial Revolution
Transport Revolution
Green Revolution
Digital Revolution (3rd Industrial Revo.)
Information Revolution
Industry 4.0 (4th Industrial Revo.)

A Public Goods Cooperative
One way to create impact is through a coalition of like-minded individuals that
believe in the power of producing things for the benefit of the public.
These individuals coalesce in positive-sum ways to foster the sustainable
creation of goods and services that benefit the public.
Forming a cooperative that focuses on some set principles, public spaces,
common areas, and open-sourced technology can empower society at the
individual level.
Open source means equal access

17

Ways a cooperative can foster positive-sum outcomes:
Productivity measurements: KPIs that underpin positive impacts.
Balanced practices that regenerate versus degenerate.
Focusing on sustainability and long-tail economic benefits.
Sharing Resources to promote mutually beneficial outcomes.
Use sustainable & enviro-conscious practices in operations.
Support local economies via insourcing goods/services.
Provide affordable and accessible goods/services to members &
communities.
Invest in education and training to empower members and strengthen the
cooperative and the community they represent.

Long Game: Sustainable Spaces For The Public
Above is a short list; tons of other areas and movements resulted in a noticeable
global change— even if it took many years to encourage or see measurable
results.
Many of our changes for the better are only possible for us to view in hindsight.
We must attempt change and shoot for inventions before we can see the results
and innovate.
Right now, we are putting profit before purpose, and consequently, we see loops
that reduce public resources to unsustainable levels because we industrialize
before we make things more efficient. It's time for a mindset shift toward
regenerative principles.
If we focus on purpose before profit, we can innovate for the greater good
instead of greater wealth. After all, if nothing is left to cultivate, there will be no
profits, and our health will deteriorate, and that's the main source of our wealth
as a society.
18

Sustainable Spaces for
the Public Benefit

0xzenodotus

19

Throughout history, many communities have suffered from degrading public
spaces due to industrialization and overconsumption.
As a result, public spaces often get seen as unsustainable and prone to
mismanagement.
However, with the rise of regenerative principles, we are beginning to see a shift
in how we view and manage these spaces.
Regeneration means restoring, renewing, and growing. Applying this concept to
public spaces involves revitalizing these areas to enhance their value and
promote sustainable practices.
Creating regenerative public spaces involves:
Rethinking planning & management.
Engaging local communities in the decision-making process.
Encouraging long-term sustainability over short-term progress.
Promoting and practicing the principles of circular economy.
Prioritizing biodiversity and ecological health.
Advocating policy changes at local levels: Bottom-up approach to policy
Supporting the protection & regeneration of public spaces
Regeneration is more than just repairing what's broken; it's about enhancing
and sustaining the value of our public spaces for future generations.

Transparent public goods
Let's imagine a world where the public maintains 'Transparent Public Goods,' a
fancy term for freely available resources that anyone can view the workings of,
and they benefit everyone.
Public libraries, community halls, leisure centers, weather data and the air we
breathe are all public resources that benefit the general public.
20

We can enhance the capability of these resources by increasing their
transparency and governing them more actively as a community. When we
understand what they cost, what benefits they bring and how we can utilize our
public resources, we can learn how to take advantage of them better.
Take Finland as an example; in Helsinki, they've developed wonderful
collaborative hubs for the community. They are public libraries, but these are
not your usual 'Shhh... Be quiet' type of libraries.
Oodi in Helsinki — Central Public Library

Floor 1 & 2 of the Oodi

They're vibrant spaces with resources promoting learning, social connection,
and community activities. Talk about a public good that benefits everyone!
We can all gauge how valuable these places are if we increase transparency.

Turning the Tide from Common Tragedies to
Common Amenities
Sadly, our world is not without its share of 'Tragedy of the Commons'
It's a grim term to describe situations where public resources get depleted or
misused, often due to a lack of accountability and ethical management.
Picture overfishing in a lake until there's not a single fish left. That's a common
tragedy.

Image by: Aquaholics

22

We, humans, are capable of extraordinary things, especially when we work
together.
By rolling our sleeves and getting our hands dirty, we can transform these
common tragedies into 'Common Amenities'.
Some Common Amenities we can build together:
Converting abandoned/derelict property to sustainable and productive land
for the public to use
Opening community hubs managed by locals for the locals
Specialized libraries staffed with people familiar with the subject matter
Open incubators and think tanks for the public
Look at what happened in Seoul, South Korea, with the Cheonggyecheon stream.

Turning the Tide from Common Tragedies to
Common Amenities
South Korea recognized problems with their long term development and the
harmony with their environment.
Older projects during the 60’s and 70’s covered up a historical stream running
through Seoul. A restoration project began after evaluation of the current
infrastructure on top of the stream.

Uncovering the stream and replacing the concrete with a more natural state
decreased the temperature of the city center and surrounding areas of the
stream— by as much as 3 to 6 degrees. A substantial difference. (see Urban Heat
Island Effect)

The Power of Cooperative Principles
In a regenerative approach, the principles of cooperation are fundamental.
The cooperative model is an excellent way to manage resources, enhance social
value, and promote sustainable practices in public spaces.
Some ways cooperative principles can foster regeneration:
Voluntary and Open Membership: Public spaces should be open and
accessible to everyone in the community. There should be no pressure to pay
a fee to access public resources. A cooperative structure also ensures
everyone has a say in decision-making processes.
Democratic Member Control: Each member has one vote, providing equal
representation. A democratic model allows the needs of the many to
outweigh those of the few.
Member Economic Participation: Members contribute to the economic
health of the cooperative and share in its success. This structure ensures that
the benefits are shared equitably among all members.
Autonomy and Independence: Cooperatives are autonomous entities
controlled by their members. This autonomy allows them to make decisions
that best serve their community.

26

Education, Training, and Information: Cooperatives invest in their
members through education and training, which helps them contribute
more effectively to the cooperative and their community.
Collaborative Cooperatives: Cooperatives support other cooperatives,
creating a network of mutual aid and shared resources.
Concern for Community: Cooperatives work for the sustainable
development of their communities. This focus ensures the long-term health
and well-being of the community and its public spaces.

Towards a Regenerative Society
A regenerative society prioritizes its communities' sustainable development and
the health of their public spaces— it values cooperation, inclusivity, and longterm prosperity over short-term profits.
However, transitioning towards a regenerative society requires fundamental
changes in how we think about and manage our public spaces.
Here are some steps we can take:
Foster a culture of cooperation and mutual aid.
Prioritize the health and well-being of the community in decision-making
processes.
Advocate for policy changes that support regenerative practices.
Promote education and awareness about sustainable practices and
regenerative principles.
Support local businesses that value sustainability and ethical practices.
Encourage innovation and the adoption of sustainable technologies.
Develop community programs that promote environmental stewardship.
As we embark on this journey towards a regenerative society, we must
remember that change takes time. But with patience, persistence, and a shared
vision, we can create a sustainable, inclusive, and regenerative future.

Sustaining Spaces for the Public - A Labour of Love
So, we've got some great public spaces, but how do we ensure they stick around
for our children and their children?
It all boils down to love and respect for these spaces. We can make a difference
by adopting eco-friendly habits, participating in local initiatives, and advocating
for responsible use of public goods.
We’ve talked about Korea, but did you know about the New York City's High
Line?
An elevated urban park that was once a rusty, old railway, abandoned and
forgotten.
Thanks to a community-driven initiative & some serious elbow grease, it has
transformed into a vibrant, green space that New Yorkers and visitors love.

attention to when issuing
NFTs?

Return to the Dunbar's number, remove the fantasy of infinitely
extending time and space of magic web3, and pay attention to digital
experiences that have boundaries! When new things are easier to create
than old ones, enduring old things can acquire immense value.
This is my first article joining the GreenPill.Network, with the Chinese version
concurrently published on Matters.town (mashbean). The GreenPill.Network
Writing Program publishes one thousand-word article per week for three
consecutive weeks, and everyone can participate in writing about web3 public
actions from all around the world. Kevin Owocki, the founder of Gitcoin,
launched the Green Pill Movement, calling on everyone to transform from
Degens (traders) to Regens (cultivators). The movement is now in its second
chapter - Global Local Connections, inviting web3 public actors from all around
the world to write and interact.

In 2022, our organization, FAB DAO (Formosa Art Bank DAO), conducted a
series of web3 experiments in Taiwan for different types of non-profit
organizations, activists, and advocates. These were mainly local actions to assist
fundraising, advocacy, and digital experiences. Some were successful, while
others were not as satisfying. We have cooperated in various forms with art
museums, art village, large-scale charity platforms, coral restoration
organizations, animal protection groups, public schools, organizations for the
elderly, human rights advocates, and others in Taiwan. I believe we have the
credentials to provide some preliminary guidance for the local 'regens' in
Taiwan.

FAB DAO Regens Event in Taiwan

For those willing to try in mid-2023, it is essential to see the pandemic era as a
special event, with phenomena that are hard to replicate. The once-famous
projects have now become moldy, and legends have turned into jokes. In that
era, when we talked about blockchain or web3, we encountered a series of
dreamlike words, such as decentralization, permissionless, trustless, scalability,
etc. These blockchain features still exist today, but they don't have much to do
with the solidarity of local communities.
Decouple these concepts from the actual people you interact with, and your
mental burden will not be so heavy. While these concepts are indeed important
and are the cornerstone of the public blockchain operation, they successfully
created amazing miracles on a global scale during the pandemic, such as crossborder showing off wealth, war donations, etc. But now, as people live face-toface again and see continuous warfare as normal, these underlying innovative
concepts won't help you achieve advocacy or fundraising effects.
33

In a permissionless blockchain, everyone can join, but bounded communities are
what create real action; trustless smart-contract machines can't automatically
produce spiritual tokens that connect each other's trust, spiritual value needs
proper context by local actors for the tokens to carry value effectively; in the
progress of scalable blockchain technology, actual digital communities shouldn't
emphasize rapid expansion of membership, as it will only diminish the chain of
trust between each other. If we pay too much attention to the quantifiable
benefits generated by tools, platforms, and tokenomics, local actors can easily
fall into the anxiety of formalism, and we should now focus more on the process
of actual solidarity. How to introduce resources, and how to use them well.
Therefore, in terms of cognition, it is very important to decouple the
technological innovation layer from the decentralised society (DeSoc) layer.
Community actors don't need to worry about how to improve the terrible user
experience of web3, web3 tools are as hard to learn as they are to teach, when
you want your participants to learn how to use it. Honestly, our past forcing the
public to learn digital wallets, collect digital assets, was like "using a complicated
period of growing pains to create a common life experience for members."
Before the digital infrastructure related to public fundraising and public
advocacy is mature, like local regulations, digital habits, and UI/UX, digital
communities should focus on creating impressive digital experiences. This is the
only intersection of the technology and society layers at present.
As the world enters an era of attention scarcity in digital life, we should focus on
the people and things around us through the process of digital production. Like
the virtual treasures in video games, the qualitative changes generated by digital
creations give rise to a sense of ‘a sense of ownership’ in subjective
consciousness. "I have that, do you have it too?" The sense of social identification
created by these virtual items is a completely new mode. ‘A sense of ownership’
and 'rights of possession' are two levels of status, with the latter being defined at
legal and social levels. When we own private property, that is a right of
possession, such as cars, houses, intellectual property rights, naming rights, etc.
However, the right of possession does not necessarily completely overlap with
the subjective inner 'sense of ownership'.
34

Sometimes, we can even jointly own a piece of work, for example, a work has a
hundred editions, each of us owns an edition, but we do not think we only own
one percent of it. Often, we each feel like we all own one piece, even though it is
identical in its bit data, and this can even create 'community identity' because we
own the same thing together. This is what is referred to as 'positive externality'.
For instance, in 2022 we co-launched the Vanishing Family series with human
rights artists. This is a series of the artist's past oil paintings. The image is a
series of family portraits, with family members in the middle disappearing,
being locked up in jail, or becoming death-row inmates. This was a very
important period in Taiwan's history, ruled by China's dictatorial government,
creating countless political prisoners. And to this day, Taiwan's political
situation has been liberalized for less than 40 years. The artist and his works are
excellent mediums for reflection on human rights.

35

We issued 100 copies of different works in this series, priced in dollars, and they
were snapped up within a few blocks. This was because what we wanted to
create was advocacy, and fundraising was secondary. The community members
who participated in the collection did not think they only collected one percent
of the fragments, but rather a story and a whole segment of history that actually
happened in Taiwan.
The 'sense of ownership' is less like 'ownership rights' and more akin to the
dissemination of knowledge. When we impart the knowledge in our heads to
others, it does not diminish the value of our acquisition of this knowledge, just
as a candle's light illuminates a room, these are all non-competitive and nonexclusive public goods. When public-interest or advocacy-type NFTs operate
successfully, although their owners are of a limited number, their 'sense of
ownership' increases exponentially through the process of user conversion. The
best part is that the generated cash flow can be directly returned to the activists.
That's why I would urge non-profit activists who can afford to pay attention to
NFT digital experiences at this time, because when new things are easier to
create than old ones, enduring old things can acquire immense value, whether
digital or not. This is my initial appeal from Taiwan to Regens around the world.

The Third Space of Anti-establishment (Anti-Algorithms)
This is the 2nd article for the GreenPill.Network global movement, with the
Chinese version published on the Matters.town (mashbean) platform. The
GreenPill Network writing project was initiated by Gitcoin founder Kevin
Owocki to encourage global local communities to voluntarily write down unique
web3 public culture.

After the trend, there is no grass here.
The bear market is a moment of truth. When someone says that minting "NFT"
can increase sales, it is a hypothesis. Looking back now, this is just a joke, just
like people said that registering the domain ".com" could make a fortune 20
years ago. These people have misunderstood the essential difference between
Buzzwords and the technological revolution. Buzzwords can indeed attract
attention, and under the amplification of social media platform algorithms,
humans are like sheep, domesticated by mechanical sheepdogs. Chasing
Buzzwords can indeed bring a rapid market, but this is like the grass in the
desert, it comes and goes quickly.
And obviously, this year's grass is growing in the AI field. The underlying
research of these two technologies is as difficult as it can be, but the application
layer can be very simple. Releasing a smart contract to access OpenSea (NFT
trading platform) can be called an NFT project; releasing a service that connects
to the API provided by ChatGPT can also be called a developer. The reduction of
entry barriers for emerging technologies, which quickly increases the number of
early developers, is indeed a key condition for igniting Buzzwords, and media,
public sectors, forums, and the public follow.
But don't just focus on the development of hardcore technology, and
underestimate the simple creativity of "connecting". The connection has created
stackability, and many unexpected application modes have begun to emerge.
This is like "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", where players thought
that the tools available to everyone, were created by Nintendo in 2023. I think
this is where Cultural Technology is important. Cultural Technology is the
interface active agent of technology, integrating technology into society, and
creating more diverse and heterogeneous application possibilities.

39

Digital Solidarity and Decentralization Tangles
Let's take a look back at the wave caused by the technology tree of "cryptography
- distributed ledger - NFT", to see what's left to assemble, among which is DAO
(Decentralized Autonomous Organization). When the marketing narrative of
the metaverse combined with the concept of NFT becomes popular, the grand
narrative cleverly combines "decentralized will", "storytelling” and "autonomous
tools". Many web3 projects claim in their roadmap that after earning wealth,
they will move towards decentralized autonomy (daoxit). In the narrative, they
weave fantasies of community co-governance and IP co-creation together; in
terms of tools, they operate through multi-sig vaults and voting deliberations.
However, in reality, some teams in Taiwan, for example, have rug pulled funds
and stopped operating (which is not uncommon in recent months), some
operators have clashed with the community, and some have lost momentum
after entering a decentralized autonomous state. "Decentralized" seems to be a
synonym worse than "saying goodbye."
But is there really no possibility for "Digital Solidarity"?
People who walk into "DAO autonomy" from "NFT project" seem to naturally
believe that holding "tokens" and voting is the so-called Digital Democracy.
However, people almost at the same time found that democracy is a goal that
seems to never be achieved. A famous NFT project in Taiwan originally had high
popularity, and the community that had online meetings every day looked
forward to entering real decentralized autonomy, but when people found that
the operators were only willing to provide a small amount of funding as
governance initial capital, the polis disbanded. These early pioneers who first
tasted digital democracy, as consumers, gradually became believers but seemed
to have not made a "promise" yet, to fulfill community autonomy under
collective cooperation.
In addition to the emerging web3 projects in Taiwan promoting the spirit of
decentralization, the open-source field has been doing so for years and has given
birth to many world-renowned projects.
40

However, under the commercial narrative of the metaverse, "decentralization"
has become a buzzword again. It is a term that has successfully risen in an era
where large commercial platforms monopolize the attention economy. Young
people (or venture capitalists) may be inspired and want to achieve commercial
success (NFT) while getting spiritual comfort (DAO). Rebellious young people
want to break down rules, oppose bureaucracy, establishment, or everything
constructed by the secular society of the older generation, which is the same in
any era. Whether it is the Cultural Revolution in China, the Hippie Movement in
America, or the Wild Lily student movement in Taiwan, these movements
contain a revolutionary will no matter how divergent their demands are.
However, the classic paper "The Tyranny of Structurelessness" by Jo Freeman, a
feminist activist from the 1970s in America, tells us that after removing the
rules, flat and non-hierarchical organizations can easily become elite circles due
to the inherent limitations of trust chain and information transmission, and
thus give rise to representative controversies, power struggles, and movement
traumas. The outcome of a movement is often not institutionalization, but the
dissipation of social mobilization.
"Decentralization" primarily faces cultural collaboration issues, followed by how
DAO tools support its spirit. In facing representative controversy, g0v in Taiwan
is a very good example. This is a long-standing (just turned ten) decentralized
organization primarily composed of hackers, initially founded with the slogan
"hack the government", and subsequently gave birth to many civic technology
projects. As g0v expanded, it inevitably faced representative disputes, but in the
end, it established the principle of “nobody can represent g0v" under
community consensus and emphasized the principle of joint notes for media
contact, which is still in use today.
How web3 projects survive, especially teams oriented towards digital art, should
reflect on the problems faced by decentralized organizations in different eras,
rather than wanting commercial success while maintaining decentralized
autonomy. Taiwan does not have a tradition of solidarity economy like Europe
or Central and South America.
41

Employees are not consciously also owners, and the community does not have
the habit of sharing commercial benefits. This is because the Cooperatives Act is
outdated and difficult to use, and it creates a situation of nominal cooperation
but actual labor employment. Therefore, "decentralization" has influenced the
social and economic level in different forms and appearances at different times,
undergoing a wave of changes brought by cooperative corporatization, social
movement, and digital tools.

Digital Solidarity and Decentralization Tangles
Despite the traumas that the decentralization movement brings to its
participants, we should still praise such endeavors. In trendy terms, these
movements have always been acts of resistance against algorithms, they
represent the third space in life. Students have a place to go besides home and
school; workers have a place to go besides home and the office. In the past, there
were social norms at home and social systems outside, an algorithm evolved
from societal culture, with attention and limited time captured in a linear world.
Today, we have entertainment algorithms at home (like TikTok) that users can
easily get lost in, and profit-oriented high-efficiency algorithms at work. In fact,
many people are now actually working alongside AI algorithms. This is a
characteristic of a high-efficiency industrial world.
However, a third space is still necessary, and it doesn't necessarily need to be
efficient. In fact, it is ineffective, noisy, and often futile. But these are important
characteristics of the public sphere that direct us not towards profit, but towards
facing communities and constructing culture, resisting algorithms, and even
things that algorithms must learn from events that machines cannot create.
"Palaces for the People" writes that people need a third space, using "Social
Infrastructure" to reverse the coldness and indifference of civil society, like
libraries, parks, and fountains. As the public enters digital life, the digital
world's DAOs are gradually taking on the benefits of such infrastructure.

42

In fact, there are precedents for digital spaces serving as social infrastructure,
like online-game guilds, forum moderators, etc. These are places that resist
algorithms and generate a lot of digital life memories. In this context, Facebook
Groups and Facebook News Feed are completely different concepts. The
massively multiplayer online game "Eve Online" has seen widely-told stories
like Chappy78's birthday party. When veteran player Chappy78 was diagnosed
with terminal pancreatic cancer, his final birthday wish was to fight an epic
space battle. Many gaming guilds and over 2000 players burned resources they
had accumulated over time to fulfill Chappy's dream with a space firework show
in the digital space. This isn't something an algorithm can do, it can only happen
in a third space without too many conflicting interests and social
responsibilities.
Just three weeks ago, the American forum Reddit was facing a dilemma between
operator profits and community protests over shutting down forums. The
operators, in order to profit, decided to start charging for their originally free
API service and implemented it after a very short announcement. In response,
the community began shutting down their sub-forums. This is the dilemma of
decentralized governance and operation. It's not just the web3 world that faces
such problems. In another interpretation, web3 can be seen as the internet's
third space. Users work in the first space, rest in the second space, and create a
culture in the third space.

The third space of Web3
An excellent example in the world of Web3 is JPG.Space. JPG is a digital art
database created from the ground up through collective intelligence. It started
operating in 2021, but unfortunately, it shut down temporarily in June. As a
curatorial experiment that lasted over two years, JPG was not constructed by art
historians, renowned curators, or artists themselves, but was a curated
collection created by crowd stacking and voting. It was not like a typical opensource collaboration platform, such as Wikipedia.
43

Instead, it consciously undertook curatorial and contextual work, involving a
large number of subjective factors and manipulative interpretations. It
resembles a community-oriented new media art institution, Rhizome, mixed
with the surfing spirit of the 2000s. This time, not only creators are involved but
also a large number of collectors and amateur critics.
In an interview with the media Right Click Saved, titled "The Power of
Community Curation", the leaders of JPG emphasized that NFT is a method of
deconstructing the art ecosystem. Community action is based on such
infrastructure like NFT, and for JPG, most actions took place on the Discord
platform. Discord, a platform loved by the gaming community, gaming circles,
and Web3, is relatively closed (you can see the content only after joining),
chaotic (non-linear content, prone to multiple channels happening at the same
time), and scares away many users who are accustomed to traditional social
platforms, yet it is widely welcomed by information surfers. Various Discords
often have different live streams, broadcasts, and AMAs (Ask Me Anything) at
night (the night in East Asian time zone).

The Canonical NFT issued by JPG.space.

44

JPG emphasizes the importance of Discord, even with its imperfections, but it is
still the "third space" for intense discussions in the web3 community. Wade
Wallerstein said: "This is not the tyranny of the masses, but a tool for
community mutual support and education." This is consistent with the concept
of the "Future Art Ecosystem 3: Art and Decentralized Technology" published by
the Serpentine Gallery. The Serpentine Gallery believes that the Web3
community operation model creates a methodology for resistance against
institutions. Whether it's the technical bottom or the cultural level, it generates
unique creative meanings and cultural values ​specific to the community, no
matter what this community represents.
Returning to the third space, the overseas experience of JPG and my personal
experience in Taiwan are consistent. Recently, with the help of FAB DAO
(Formosa Art Bank), local group "Huangxi Environmental Education
Programme (HEEP)" conducted a series of environmental education actions,
proving that social infrastructure and digital solidarity collaboration are
possible to unite. Huangxi is a river located in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. Due
to urbanization, the river has gone through stages of natural ecology, landscape,
and concretization. The Huangxi team is slowly opening the public participation
process through a lot of curation, research, and conversations with local
communities and schools. The "Huangxi Environmental Education Programme"
had a fun river RPG with primary school students at Mingde Elementary School
at the end of June, discussing what the river near their homes looks like. Using
the interactive "Tamagotchi at riverside " NFT as a medium, they try to create a
process of interaction between students and parents through this symbolic
token.

The creators, actors, and planners all come from DAO, and it happens that these
participants have different local memories with Huangxi. The cooperation
process of these people is concretely and microscopically displayed on platforms
related to Discord. In the past, FAB DAO has helped teachers and students of
Taipei Municipal Zhong Shan Girls High School to deal with the time and space
tokens of campus historical buildings, helped teachers and elderly people at
Longtan Elderly Center to create paper-cutting creations, and cooperated with
museums and art villages to practice the possibility of chain community
interaction. These non-profit projects are attempts to incorporate NFT,
symbolizing a certain spirit, into the third space.

Internet Autonomy Region
This month, we discussed the concept of the Network State with Mask Network
founder Suji Yan. The Network State is an emerging concept, initiated and
written by Balaji, and has now become a social movement in the Web3 world.
This theory suggests that when a digital community's technology, culture, and
economics mature, an autonomous body without borders or territory is likely to
emerge, overlaying traditional sovereign nations. Suji believes that our
generation has not yet reached this mature state. At best, we are the generation
before the founder’s grandfathers. When the infrastructure of a virgin land is
not yet mature, it is a necessary measure to exchange resources from the colonial
motherland (real economies and enterprises) (see the full interview: Suji Yan
talks about the generation of Network State).
This prompts us to reexamine, is digital solidarity really happening? Whether
it's the exceptional state of the third space, or the public domain in a democratic
society; in terms of the development of digital culture's basic infrastructure, is
the emerging Web3 toolkit an inevitable path? Beginning from protests and war
zones, we have seen official cryptocurrency wallets and peace-supporting
Ukraine DAO in Ukraine, attracting global supporters' funds for practical help.
Similarly, on the subject of Russia, the famous protest group Pussy Riot issued
the NFT "Putin’s Ashes" and produced a protest-style MV, and they were wanted
by the Russian government because of the issuance of the NFT.

NFT: Putin's Ashes by Pussy Riot

49

In cross-border issues, NFT is an effective advocacy tool, and DAO is a collection
of effective tools for coordinating cooperation and asset management. Urgent
situations often bring about creative and effective "connection" methods. Back
within a single national boundary, whether local communities can benefit from
DAO at this stage to achieve substantial cooperation, such as digital asset
management, cooperative division of labor and profit sharing, issue
communication and marketing (at this point it must be reiterated, as a
Buzzword, the wave of DAO is no longer in place), these are within the scope of
culture technology and how to continue to create unique culture for the digital
public domain, surpassing the algorithm dominating the first and second
spaces, this is a phenomenon worth observing at the moment.
Together with the director of the Taiwan Labor Front Research Department,
Hong Jing-shu, freelance translators Liu Wei-Jen and Liao Pei-Xing, we
discussed how cooperation should happen in different fields under the theme of
The Dynamic of Cooperation at the beginning of the year. We have studied
whether the landing of DAO in Taiwan can apply the Cooperative Law.
According to the database of laws and regulations of the Republic of China, the
Cooperative Law was promulgated in the 1934 and last amended in the 2015. It is
no longer applicable in the digital or cultural field. Hong Jing-shu pointed out
that the context of cooperatives in the Taiwan is different from the tradition of
cooperatives in Europe and America, which can easily be misleading. In fact,
there are precedents in Taiwan for initiating cooperatives as legal entities in the
field of arts, such as the Co-Art Co-Operative initiated by Huang Sunquan, and
the still-operating Scutoid Coopertion, and others like Les Petites Choses
Production, a performance art group that has entered substantial cooperation
under a non-cooperative legal entity.

50

Conclusion: Independent and Persevering
From the overseas experiment of JPG, the domestic state of Huangxi digital
solidarity, to the Taiwanese cooperatives in form or substance, and finally back
to the Network State, we can clearly see that the legal sources and tools of
physical society are hardly able to meet the needs of digital communities. The
infrastructure is not yet mature, but the third space is still present.
Through the observation of Web3, we have the opportunity to examine the
influence of non-legal entities on social culture. We can probably affirm that the
infrastructure of the Internet space is inherently decentralized and is naturally
conditioned to continue towards a state of multi-centric and diverse
heterogeneity.
Perhaps the best cultural tool is one that allows everyone to independently
develop culture. As a reality condition for digital solidarity, be independent and
persevere.

From “degrowth" to "abundance",
from "decentralization" to “plurality”,
from "decoupling" to "complexity".
In the abundant pluriverse, we have finally found digital democracy.

This article is one of the parts of the GreenPill.Network global movement, with
the Chinese version published on the matters platform. The Green Pill Network
writing project, initiated by Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, encourages global
local communities to write about the unique public culture of web3
spontaneously. This is the last piece in the series, discussing the concept of
digital democracy.

53

GreenPill.Network encourages practitioners of web3 to become Regen (short for
Regenerative, also the antonym of Degen, which refers to speculators). In the
first article, I discussed how NFTs, apart from serving as digital certificates,
become symbolic tokens for local communities - advanced human technology
becoming almost religious artifacts. Sacred objects gain powerful spiritual
significance through a religious context, and social advocacy NFTs, through
processes of collaboration and cooperation, are imbued with the consensus of
the community. These consensuses become stories, slowly disseminating into
other communities, creating low-efficiency yet strong connections. In the
second article, I discussed how digital public spheres can be established and the
preciousness of these low-efficiency unity movements against the prevalent
algorithms, drawing from real-world web3 community practices.
In this third article, I attempt to discuss the ultimate imagination of Regen—
Digital Democracy, a bold attempt. Overseas, Taiwan is often seen as the island
of digital democracy. However, those of us in Taiwan are still troubled by
polarization every day. Past successes seem like fleeting moments, and the
trauma caused by digital social movements has driven many open, free, and
democratic practitioners out of the third space. They return to their families and
jobs, occasionally reminiscing about the past on social platforms. The next
generation, who have not experienced the waves of digital transformation and
movements, live as if these histories of digital democracy never happened. They
remain entangled in the algorithmically addictive world, and in the end, they all
suffer from algorithmic abuse.
The following article can be considered as reading notes, distilling the essence of
the past six months of web3 for all and da0 learning reading group discussions.
In the atmosphere of intensive reading and discussion, we gradually practice
while reading, slowly grasping necessary narratives, becoming theoretical
nourishment. Meanwhile, working in Taiwan's Ministry of Digital
Affairs(moda), section of plurality, I also strive to explore the meaning of
Plurality.
54

Audrey Tang, the minister of moda, is the official inventor of the term Plurality.
Audrey and Glen Weyl are currently writing a book, "Plurality" (which can be
considered as another style of "GreenPilled", or a sequel to "Radical Market").
The Plurality Institute has held two physical symposiums in the US to discuss
many related studies between emerging technologies and democratic society.
The Plurality Tokyo Forum is also carving out its own localized path.
The following discussion only represents my personal standpoint and does not
represent any DAO or centralized organization.
n the narrative concept of Plurality, Glen Weyl proposed three possible future
pathways, correspondingly mapped to the latest civilization regimes in
Civilization VI: Entrepreneurial Sovereignty (ES), Abundance Technocracy (AT),
and Digital Democracy. Let's expand the theory with these core principles.
Entrepreneurial Sovereignty is advocated by Silicon Valley's accelerationists
and singularity believers. It is a technology world that maximizes capitalism,
where the spirit of man conquers nature may lead to greater social inequality,
and all information content is privatized into intangible assets that can be
calculated as GDP. Abundance Technocracy is a highly efficient, convenient, and
uniform single-pole world developed when a totalitarian government fully
controls digital tools. The development of AI can align collective will with a
single ideology.
Digital Democracy, as a third way, creates digital lifestyles that meet the needs
of the public. Glen Weyl believes that Plurality serves as the technical
implementation of Digital Democracy, bridging the gap between a democratic
society and emerging technologies, such as quadratic voting, Harberger taxes,
language models that align diverse opinions, online deliberation tools, etc.

55

The above three can be reduced to three economic types:
1. Entrepreneurial Sovereignty: Market Economics
2. Abundance Technocracy: Planned Economics
3. Digital Democracy: Cooperative Economics

Expanding the internal concepts through Glen Weyl's Civilization Development Triangle.

56

Essentially, market economies and planned economies are on a spectrum, which
is relatively close. The cooperative economy is another dimension, which
transcends this spectrum. The cooperative economy, fully named the Social
Solidarity Economy (SSE), serves as an umbrella term for alternative economies,
underground economies, cooperativism, and more, widely seen in Central and
South American and European cultures. I became familiar with this term
through Dr. Chi-jen Wu(
) of the Taiwan Economic Democracy Union
(recommend book: "The Human Conditions of Taiwan’s Sovereignty") and Dr.
Ching-Shu Hung(
), director of the research department of the Taiwan
Labour Front (recommend book: "When Labor Hires Capital: Overturning
Capitalism with Economic Democracy"). Both teachers have talked about Nordic
democracy to economic democracy and social investment, reflecting on the
status of cooperatives in Taiwan.

洪敬舒

Digital democracy, when directly translated in Chinese, can mean using digital
methods to support democracy, such as open government data, open
supervision, online deliberation, electronic voting, identity verification, and so
on; it can also imply a coexistence of various (plural) forms of democracy.
However, this state of coexistence must be based on a cooperative economic
model. If it is a market economy growth path for the future, democracy is likely
to become a secondary consideration or even a manipulated tool. So, it is boldly
hypothesized here that digital democracy and the cooperative economy are two
sides of the same concept; they contain too many similar ideas. According to the
article "Why I Am a Pluralist?" by Glen Weyl, the term "cooperative liberal
democratic pluralism" is condensed into “plurality”, which emphasizes the
importance of cooperation.
Let's continue to build upon this. In the spectrum between market economy and
planned economy, three concepts appear at different costs: artificially scarce
goods, closed technologies, and atomism.

57

Information is fluid and was originally shared until someone monopolized it,
artificially packaging and selling it, turning it into artificially scarce goods.
These could be valued-added via designing, packaging, and curating process, but
they also become inaccessible resources. Opposite to artificially scarce goods are
public goods, especially Digital Public Goods (DPGs) in an information society.
Closed technologies, like nuclear energy or AI models that have not yet been
open-sourced, are more likely to fall into the hands of technology elites or
bureaucrats as they advance, making technology increasingly distant from
citizens. In contrast, open technologies can be used mutually through standards
and open licensing formats.
People's work habits in modern society are hierarchical and atomized,
accustomed to obtaining their tasks through layers of information transmission.
In this framework, people are divided into individual units without
characteristics and manipulated within a larger structure. Opposite this concept
is the spirit of flat organizations and united cooperation.
Therefore, the corresponding concepts are displayed as follows:
1. Artificially scarce goods - Digital Public Goods
2. Closed technologies - Open technologies
3. Hierarchy and atomization - Flatness and unity
These three concepts are mentioned extensively in various theories.

58

As Kohei Saito, known for his research on Marx's later works, advocates the
concept of Degrowth. He believes that only by abandoning capitalism and the
dream of greenwashing and advanced carbon reduction technologies can the
natural environment be resolved because only when humans give up unlimited
growth can they enter a state of true abundance. In his book "Capital in the
Anthropocene,”(
) he spends a lot of time explaining the
concepts of public and private goods, emphasizing the importance of open
technologies. We can ask here: in the digital world, how can we contribute and
meet our needs to achieve abundance?

人新世の「資本論」

The spirit of the plurality, briefly mentioned above, serves as a bridge between
emerging technology and a democratic society. The integral part of it is
decentralization, which involves deconstructing the center, breaking down
concepts, technologies, and operation modes, and only then is multi-centrism
possible. We can easily see the benefits of multi-centric operations in the world
of web3. For example, avoiding single-point of failures(SPOF), decentralizing
identities(DIDs), partial common ownership(PCO), and quadratic voting(QV) for
automated and permissionless possibilities. Of course, the Plurality also
emphasizes universally accessible digital public goods services, promotes
interoperability of open technologies, and emphasizes cooperate across
difference(CAD).
Finally, there is decoupling, a term taken from Joichi Ito's "The Practice of
Change." He describes the history of Internet development with decoupling. He
believes that the development of the Internet is like a pendulum, swinging from
centralization to decentralization. And on different levels, it can be decoupled,
allowing invented standards or things to no longer monopolize. When a tool can
be easily used, it has the space to evolve. Different levels of technology, people,
and events can operate repeatedly on a simple scale, giving birth to complex
systems. Although complex systems may not be as efficient for a single task,
they are almost universally applicable to various changes, thus creating
resilience and coping with various situations. The solidarity economy can be
seen in worlds where various regimes collapse and are maintained by small
community autonomies, which can quickly respond to changes. Of course, this
group is inherently decentralized and in a state of abundance.
59

1. From "Degrowth" to "Abundance"
2. From "Decentralization" to “Plurality”
3. From "Decoupling" to "Complexity"

Summary: The mindset that a Regen should have
In the world of digital democracy, being a Regen possibly means engaging in
matters you identify with and making limited decisions in a complex
environment. When an individual collaborates with those they identify with,
forming one or more Pods (or DAOs), and still works across differences with
groups they less identify with (or so-called associate between cooperatives), it is
ultimately possible to "give according to ability, take according to needs" in an
abundant environment. This is an ideal description for public goods and the
third space(digital public sphere), though reality is more austere. Taiwan as an
island facing significant threats, we can't afford to miss any opportunities for
external aid collaboration, inevitably getting entwined in the complex network
of international political relations. Yet the internet has been open for
connections since the very beginning. Perhaps we can revisit the spirit of
"openness," "sharing," and “solidarity” through the history of internet
development and continue creating abundance.
To conclude, reaching the realm of digital democracy may require discussions
about the cooperative economy.
The cooperative economy could possibly appear in three states simultaneously:
"abundance" after degrowth, a “plurality” after decentralization, and
"complexity" after decoupling.
These three characteristics are based on three features: "public goods," "open
technologies," and "flat and solidarity.”

60

These three features could potentially allow us to break away from the
dichotomous narrative of market economy versus planned economy. The
direction of web3 Regen development could be its latest standard-bearer, which
is conceptually elaborated in the third article of the Green Pill Writing Program.
Although this is the conclusion of the three-article independent writing plan for
the Green Pill and only explains a schematic diagram, it is also the beginning of
discussing Digital Solidarity. Many concepts might seem inconclusive, but the
back-and-forths often overlap considerably, gradually building up an
international consensus that becomes the theoretical foundation for
practitioners.

The Magic of Touching
Grass

lanadingwall.eth

62

What if touching grass was one of the most profound
and important things we could ever do?
It is not merely a physical action; it symbolizes a reconnection with ourselves,
nature, and our intrinsic motivations. It represents what can be a transformative
journey that leads us to gain perspective and rediscover what truly matters in
life. In a world that constantly demands our attention, touching grass allows us
to create a small moment of peace.
This may seem complex for such a simple act, but most of us have experienced
moments of connection with nature. Whether we were alone or with friends,
hiking, walking the dog, or simply gazing out the window as we drove by, we
have all felt fleeting moments when we were lifted out of our troubles and felt a
deep connection to something greater.
The connection and solace nature offers are always available to us; we just need
to remember to seek them out. Grounding ourselves is essential for personal
growth, adaptability, and a thriving life.
In areas where we feel insecure, we often compensate with insatiable desires.
However, the pursuit of more for the sake of more does not lead to fulfillment;
instead, it keeps us trapped on a never-ending hamster wheel, perpetually
stressed and exhausted.
Touching grass invites us to reconnect with ourselves, nature, and what truly
brings us joy. It challenges conventional notions of "good" and "bad," "right" and
"wrong," allowing us to escape the culture wars that breed anger and fingerpointing. By embracing interconnectedness and accepting the complexities of
our world, we can cultivate regenerative mindsets, habits, and actions.
This is not only beneficial for our body, mind, and soul but also carries wider
significance.

63

The regenerative movement emphasizes leveraging web3 technology to redirect
capital, attention, and resources toward projects with positive-sum global
impact. However, the philosophy of ‘touching grass’ holds power not just in the
context of a meme phrase on Twitter, but also in our personal lives.
In order to create a regenerative world outside of us, we need to learn how to
cultivate a regenerative world inside of us.
Each of us harbours an inner "degen," driven by the pursuit of money, influence,
and power because we live in a world that can trick us into thinking these things
are most important.
We must break free from the scarcity mentality loop that this thinking can
create.
By aligning with this part of ourselves, we are choosing to view life through the
lens of scarcity. We believe that for there to be winners, there must be losers. In
order for us to feel good about ourselves, we must be ‘better’ than someone else.
Although the "number go up" mentality prevalent in this space can be incredibly
frustrating, it serves as a signal. Many people feel trapped in their lives and
circumstances, yearning for change. Crypto and NFTs have been placed on a
pedestal, worshipped as potential catalysts for transforming their lives. This
signifies a deep desire for change. However, they overlook the fact that the safest
bet they can ever make is on themselves.
It is through showing up and putting in the necessary work to build the future
we desire that we can truly make it a reality. In the absence of knowing what
constitutes a well-lived life, many people chase wealth and status because they
have been led to believe that these external markers will bring happiness.

64

Web3 stands at a crossroads, where values, hope, power, money, and
opportunity converge. What sets this moment apart is the accessibility of
information, the fundamentals of blockchain technology (crypto), and the
formation of decentralized, global communities. This convergence grants us an
opportunity to bet on ourselves and our communities and help create a win-win
world.
While power and money can be redistributed, the process is bound to be messy
until we determine what that redistribution looks like. It also demands that we
take more responsibility for ourselves, which involves decoupling our worship
of others based solely on their status and wealth, instead valuing substance and
genuine contributions.
Going into nature provides us with moments of presence, beauty and
connectedness that help give us glimpses into what could be if we remove
ourselves from the hampster wheels we find ourselves on.
Wealth and money provide stability and choices that can significantly enhance
our quality of life. However, they do not define a life well-lived.
Daniel Schmachtenberger once asked, "What is a desirable life?" Our desires
vary based on our upbringing, as they are conditioned within us. We must ask
ourselves, "What is truly worth desiring?" To free ourselves from the
conditioning of desire, we can reflect on people's experiences on their deathbeds.
What mattered most to them was connection, love, and presence. Their regrets
revolved around not expressing love more, not being fully present, and not
spending enough time engaging in activities they loved with the people they
cared about.
Living a meaningful life requires a deep connection with our intrinsic
motivations rather than relying solely on external factors. Touching grass serves
as the initial step towards this realization.

65

Various disciplines, such as science, psychology, medicine, healing practices,
religious texts, and stories, all attest to the benefits of spending time in nature. It
improves our mental health, supports physical well-being, enhances cognition,
and fosters a sense of connectedness with the world around us. Yet, the majority
of us rarely dedicate meaningful time to immerse ourselves in nature.
Remembering to touch grass, particularly during times of stress, overwhelm,
anger, fear and sadness, represents a genuine step towards leading a happier and
more fulfilling life. By reconnecting with what truly matters—ourselves and the
sources of genuine meaning in our lives—we can initiate this process simply by
stepping outside and immersing ourselves in nature.
This entails intentionally carving out time and space to embrace the natural
world around us.
In a world that often leaves us feeling disconnected, there is an innate desire
within each of us to seek out connection. This guide will provide practical and
philosophical resources geared towards exploring what "touching grass" might
mean for you and how to do it more often. It is a guide crafted with the sole
purpose of reigniting your connection to the natural world and helping you
hopefully find the deep sense of belonging and fulfillment that we all crave.

Embracing Our
Inner Connection
with Nature
lanadingwall.eth

67

Nature, with its vast interconnectedness and ever-changing dynamics, possesses
a profound awareness. Flowers bloom at the right time, birds migrate
instinctively, and animals know when to hibernate. They don't rely on Google
calendar invites, weather apps, or AI assistants to guide them.
What's fascinating is that we too are part of nature, and we can tap into our own
inner knowing through awareness and connection.
Have you ever felt an overwhelming desire to sit or lie down on the floor when
you're feeling anxious, tired, or overwhelmed? This instinctive urge is our way
of grounding ourselves, getting as close as possible to our physical ground.
Just this past weekend, my teammate and I found ourselves instinctively lying
on the floor immediately after submitting our hackathon project. It wasn't the
couch, the beanbag, a bed or a chair—our bodies knew that connecting with the
ground was the best way to ground ourselves after a 36-hour sprint hackathon.
Similarly, when we say, "I just need some fresh air" and step outside, our bodies
are urging us to connect with nature. Even the mere sounds of nature have a
relaxing effect on us.
"Touching Grass" is about reconnecting with the inner compass that guides us
toward peace and what is meaningful to us. It means cultivating a nourishing
environment both within us and outside of us. Peace doesn't mean a constant
state of calm; it means finding our footing amidst the chaos of life and knowing
that we'll navigate whatever comes next.
It's about connection.

68

One of my favourite quotes is by Bruce Lee: "Under duress, we do not rise to our
level of expectation, we fall to our level of training."
"Touching Grass" is actually a way to train ourselves to have the capacity for
more, without succumbing to our more destructive tendencies and habits. It
allows us to find our footing during times of stress and overwhelm because we
have the tools and training needed to support ourselves. It is about helping us
train to connect instead of disconnect with ourselves and the world around us.

Why does going into nature help us?
Quiet reflection: Being in nature provides a peaceful and serene environment
that allows us to detach from the noise and distractions of everyday life. It
creates space for introspection and self-reflection, helping us reconnect with our
inner thoughts and emotions.
Sensory experience: Nature engages all our senses, from the sound of rustling
leaves to the scent of flowers and the feel of soft grass beneath our feet. This
sensory experience awakens our awareness and brings us into the present
moment, fostering a deeper connection with ourselves.
Grounding and mindfulness: Nature has a grounding effect on us. Walking
barefoot on the earth, touching trees, or sitting by a flowing stream can help us
feel rooted and connected to the present. It encourages mindfulness, allowing us
to fully experience the present moment and be more attuned to our thoughts,
feelings, and sensations.
72

Inner peace and calm: Nature has a calming effect on our nervous system. The
soothing sounds, natural beauty, and tranquil environment of nature can help
reduce stress, anxiety, and mental fatigue, allowing us to find inner peace and
achieve a state of calmness.
Perspective and clarity: Being in nature can provide a fresh perspective and
clarity of mind. It offers a break from the demands and pressures of daily life,
allowing us to gain new insights, reevaluate priorities, and find clarity on our
goals, values, and aspirations.
Authenticity, self-acceptance and meaning: Nature has a way of reminding
us of our inherent authenticity. It teaches us to embrace our true selves, just as it
accepts and celebrates the uniqueness of every flower, tree, and creature. A
tulip’s beauty doesn’t take away from the beauty of a peony, if anything their
combined presence is beneficial for all. The same is true for us. In nature's
presence, we can let go of societal expectations and reconnect with our authentic
selves. We are able to connect to what is meaningful to us.
Nature is inherently wise. It is deeply interconnected with the world around it,
and through this interconnectedness, it possesses profound wisdom. This
wisdom is not exclusive to nature alone; it is also available to us because we are
an integral part of nature's tapestry.
By immersing ourselves in nature and engaging with its beauty and tranquillity,
we create opportunities to reconnect with our inner selves, find inner peace,
gain clarity, and foster a deeper sense of self-acceptance, authenticity, and
connection to what is truly meaningful to us.

What brings meaning to life, and more specifically, what brings meaning to your
life?
We've all thought about it, some more than others. But the quality of our lives is
often determined by the quality of the questions we ask ourselves and others.
But in our disconnected, always virtually plugged-in world, we can often find
ourselves reacting to the world around us instead of finding healthy ways to engage
with it.
We need to find ways back to connection, back to discovering what is meaningful

What would happiness and living look like to you if
you didn’t try to measure it, but instead experienced
it?
As a child, I would lose myself in nature during long summer days, especially by
water. It was the perfect backdrop for my daydreams about the future and the
person I aspired to be. Initially, I became entangled in the usual concerns society
tells us to care about – job titles, finding "the one," and chasing worldly success.
But being in nature offered me the space to question the significance of those
pursuits. I reflected upon the people I loved the most, those who made me feel safe
and cared for. Their jobs or wealth didn't matter; what truly mattered was how they
made me feel.
That realization led me to question whether the things society emphasizes—
materialistic possessions and identity markers—truly hold the key to a fulfilling
life.
Out there, surrounded by nature's beauty, I had a profound revelation: Nature is
indifferent to the things we obsess over—money, possessions, or fitting into neat
little boxes. It helped me realize that perhaps there's more to life than meets the
eye.

Awakening to Nature's Wisdom and Meaningful
Connections
Nature has an extraordinary way of unveiling the interconnectedness of
everything. Each living thing, regardless of size, plays a crucial role in the grand
tapestry of existence. It's like a magnificent puzzle, where every piece matters.
And guess what? The same applies to us, to you.
The meaning of our lives extends beyond personal achievements and selfgratification. It radiates from the impact we have on others and the ways in which
we connect like the gentle ripples spreading across a pond. Our words, actions, and
choices can create a ripple effect that extends far beyond what we can see.

78

Research supports the transformative power of nature. Numerous studies have
shown that spending time in natural environments reduces stress, enhances
cognitive function, and boosts creativity (Source: Kaplan, S. (1995). The restorative
benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework. Journal of Environmental
Psychology, 15(3), 169-182).
Yet many of us don’t spend enough time in it.

This photo merges the IRL and digital world and is taken from the Astrid Park Project

In our increasingly digital world, social media platforms keep us trapped in a cycle
of disconnection. They perpetuate tribalism, anger, and echo chambers, further
distancing us from the complex realities of both nature and ourselves

79

Awakening to Nature's Wisdom and Meaningful
Connections
Touching grass is an act of defiance—a defiance against a world filled with hate. It's
about choosing love, listening to those we disagree with, finding common ground,
and supporting our collective communities. In a world that can oftentimes feel
chaotic, cruel, and disconnected, touching grass is an act of bravery—a step
towards reconnecting ourselves with our true essence.
It helps us step off the hamster wheel of daily life, granting space, perspective, and
presence.
Going for a walk may seem simple, yet it's an opportunity to release the day's
energy and reconnect with ourselves.
Embarking on a hike may seem just like physical activity, but it offers a valuable
opportunity to engage with our inner dialogue in a supportive manner. It allows us
to overcome the challenges of the hike, rather than succumbing to the temptation
to give up.
Touching grass may seem mundane, yet it grounds us and connects us with nature
as a whole.
There's much to discover about ourselves, our loved ones, our passions, and our
potential. Plugging into nature as an energy source supports us on this
extraordinary journey.

80

So, here's my call to action for you:
Take a moment today to reconnect with nature. Step outside, feel the warmth of the
sun on your skin, breathe in the fresh air, and immerse yourself in the natural
world. Whether it's a leisurely walk in a nearby park, a hike in the mountains, or
simply sitting beneath a tree, allow yourself to be fully present in the moment and
let nature work its magic on you.
And then ask yourself what would happiness and living look like to you if you
didn’t try to measure it, but instead experienced it.
Together, let's embrace the wisdom of nature, discover our authentic selves, and let
our actions resonate with the interconnectedness of all living beings. Nature is full
of beauty, and we are a part of nature. By filling our lives with beauty, meaning, and
connection, we can truly thrive.

Bridging the Gap: A Regen
Guide to Integrating
Conservation Biology and
DeSci Web3 Tools in the
Anthropocene - Part 1
Rodrigo NuñΞz

82

Foreword
This groundbreaking guide serves as a compass, guiding conservation biologists
through the unexplored territory of decentralized science and Web3
technologies in the context of our rapidly changing world.
In the Anthropocene, where human activities have significant impacts on our
planet, it is crucial for us to embrace innovative approaches that promote
sustainability, collaboration, and transparency. This guide empowers
conservation biologists to harness the full potential of DeSci and Web3 tools,
equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate this digital
frontier.

I. Introduction to DeSci and Web3 Technologies
I.I. Understanding Decentralized Science (DeSci) in the
Anthropocene
In the face of unprecedented environmental challenges brought about by human
activities, the concept of Decentralized Science (DeSci) emerges as a promising
approach to address complex conservation issues in the Anthropocene. The
Anthropocene represents a new geological epoch characterized by the profound
impact of human activities on the Earth's ecosystems.
DeSci refers to a decentralized and collaborative framework that harnesses the
power of Web3 technologies to facilitate scientific research and conservation
efforts. It recognizes the importance of decentralization, transparency, and
collaboration as essential elements in addressing the multifaceted challenges of
the Anthropocene.

83

ntegrating DeSci principles in conservation biology is crucial for several
reasons. Firstly, the Anthropocene is marked by interconnected and global
environmental problems that require a collaborative and interdisciplinary
approach. By decentralizing scientific processes and promoting collaboration,
DeSci enables scientists and conservationists from diverse backgrounds to work
together and leverage their collective knowledge and expertise.
Moreover, DeSci fosters transparency in scientific research and decisionmaking processes. It promotes open access to data, methodologies, and findings,
allowing for increased scrutiny, reproducibility, and accountability. This
transparency not only strengthens the credibility of scientific endeavors but also
empowers stakeholders to actively participate in the conservation discourse.
In the context of the Anthropocene, resilience and adaptive capacity are crucial
for addressing the rapid and unpredictable changes occurring in ecosystems.
DeSci, with its emphasis on collaboration and decentralized decision-making,
enhances the capacity of conservation efforts to respond to these challenges. By
involving local communities, indigenous knowledge holders, and other
stakeholders, DeSci promotes context-specific approaches and adaptive
management strategies that can better address the unique needs and
vulnerabilities of ecosystems and communities.
Furthermore, the regenerative approach plays a fundamental role in both
sociocultural and ecological complex systems. By adopting regenerative
principles, conservation biology can move beyond mere preservation and
restoration towards the active renewal and regeneration of ecosystems and
communities. The regenerative approach recognizes the interdependence
between social, cultural, and ecological systems, emphasizing the importance of
nurturing mutually beneficial relationships and promoting the well-being of
both human and non-human entities.

84

In conclusion, the integration of DeSci principles in conservation biology, along
with a regenerative approach, holds great promise for effectively addressing the
complex challenges of the Anthropocene. By embracing decentralization,
transparency, collaboration, and regenerative practices, we can leverage the
power of Web3 technologies to foster resilience, adaptability, and innovation in
conservation efforts. As we embark on this journey, it is crucial to recognize the
importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the inclusion of diverse
perspectives to ensure the long-term sustainability and regeneration of our
sociocultural and ecological systems in the Anthropocene and beyond.

I.II. Exploring Web3 Technologies for Conservation
Biologists
In the fast-paced digital era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, DeSci Web3
technologies offer immense potential for revolutionizing the field of
conservation biology. These technologies, which include blockchain, smart
contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), have the power to enhance
data integrity, traceability, and stakeholder engagement in conservation efforts.
Web3 technologies operate on the principles of decentralization and
transparency. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where data and decisionmaking authority are concentrated in a single entity, Web3 technologies
distribute these functions across a network of participants. This decentralization
ensures that data and information are accessible to all, eliminating the need for
intermediaries and fostering trust among stakeholders.

85

One of the key components of Web3 technologies is blockchain. Blockchain is a
digital ledger that records and verifies transactions in a transparent and
immutable manner. In the context of conservation biology, blockchain can be
used to securely store and share data related to species populations, habitat
monitoring, and biodiversity assessments. This ensures that data remains
tamper-proof and can be audited by interested parties, promoting scientific
rigor and accountability.
Smart contracts, another vital aspect of Web3 technologies, are self-executing
contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code. These contracts
facilitate automated transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and
reducing transaction costs. In conservation biology, smart contracts can be
utilized to establish agreements between different stakeholders, such as
landowners, researchers, and government agencies, ensuring fair compensation
for conservation efforts and enabling efficient resource allocation.
Decentralized applications (dApps) are user-friendly interfaces that leverage the
power of blockchain and smart contracts. These applications provide a usercentric approach, allowing conservation biologists to access and interact with
data, collaborate with other researchers, and engage with stakeholders in a
transparent and efficient manner. Through dApps, conservationists can
streamline data collection, analysis, and reporting processes, saving valuable
time and resources.
Web3 tools offer numerous benefits for conservation biologists in the
Anthropocene. By promoting data integrity and traceability, these technologies
enable researchers to make evidence-based decisions and develop informed
conservation strategies. Additionally, the transparency and accessibility of

🌱 What is the carbon market
and how can blockchain
technology provide a
solution?
Gökçe Ertuğrul

102

Major problems that blockchain can solve in the
carbon market
In this article, I discussed the problems in carbon markets under transparency
and shared potential blockchain solutions with you.
The variety of emission sources, particularly in agriculture and forestry, makes
precise data collection challenging. Furthermore, developing standardized
procedures for measuring and reporting across industries and regions is difficult
that needs global cooperation and consensus.
Another problem is ensuring the accuracy and reliability of provided data,
as there is a possibility of incorrect or illegal reporting, which may
compromise the carbon market’s efficacy and legitimacy. To address these
difficulties, reliable and transparent MRV systems must be developed,
techniques must be harmonized, and blockchain technology can be used for
reliable data collecting and verification.
Firstly, the transparent nature of blockchain’s public ledger can uncover the
variety of credit supply, encompassing traditional, specialized, and innovative
project types and methodologies. This structure, which can be accessed and
followed by everyone, will strengthen the achievement of the 2 degrees target,
which must be achieved by 2030 within the Paris Agreement, particularly in the
carbon markets, as I mentioned in the tweet.
Source tracking and verification of credits are important in the journey of
carbon credits to both preserve their value and prevent market manipulation
throughout the trade. Therefore the traceability feature of blockchain can
validate the provenance of carbon credits and offer an unchangeable record of
actions along the value chain.

103

Another problem under transparency is the equal knowledge and objective
finality of all those affected by the carbon markets that drive us to the
settlement feature of blockchain. Since carbon markets include a wide range of
participants, local recipients are another concern due to the lack of
transparency. So automation of compensations can be integrated with
blockchain that increasing transparency in how funds reach them.

Major problems that blockchain can solve in the
carbon market
Blockchain technology offers exciting solutions to the difficulties of carbon
market transparency. It improves the reliability and integrity of reported data
by utilizing its transparent and irreversible nature, reducing the possibility of
fraud or incorrect reporting. Furthermore, blockchain allows standards and
interoperability by enabling traceability, automating data gathering and
verification procedures, and standardization. These features create enhanced
reliability, market integrity, and responsibility among players, resulting in more
accurate emission measurement and reporting. While blockchain deployment in
carbon markets would need collaborative efforts and regulatory assistance, its
potential to transform the way emissions are measured, recorded, and
confirmed is significant.
I personally can say that it’s very exciting to see many blockchain solutions
through climate solutions like carbon markets may develop a more transparent,
efficient, and trustworthy mechanism to address climate change by integrating
blockchain innovations.

Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
If we continue with the example of Bitcoin, our topic will be the energy resources
used for electricity production. For this reason, if the energy sources used to
generate electricity are replaced with renewable energy sources, it will make a
significant difference. You might be thinking like:
“Hey, bitcoin will consume the same amount of energy even with renewable
energy sources. What's the difference?”
The answer is: Carbon footprint
Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, or hydropower can be
used to power blockchain mining operations. Blockchain businesses may
dramatically lower their carbon footprint by moving away from fossil fuel-based
energy. Creating relationships with renewable energy suppliers or investing in
on-site renewable energy infrastructure guarantees that these enterprises have a
cleaner energy source.

Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
As most of you might think, the Ethereum Merge was something big in 2022 for
the reduction of the environmental impact of Ethereum. I am pleased about the
Merge, as Ethereum is a project that has the potential to set an example for many
projects.
Replacing PoW consensus with PoS has great potential to reduce carbon
emissions. PoW techniques use a lot of energy, but PoS algorithms eliminate the
need for resource-intensive mining entirely. PoS minimizes the processing
resources required to maintain the blockchain by selecting validators to produce
new blocks based on their stake and eliminates difficult mathematical
challenges.

106

Carbon Offsetting Initiatives
Let me give a quick brief about carbon offsetting; Carbon offsetting includes
processes that compensate for or neutralize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
generated by investing in actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal
is to achieve a balance between emitted carbon and the reduction of an
equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere.
Blockchain projects can also participate in carbon offset schemes to offset their
emissions. They can invest in programs that minimize greenhouse gas
emissions, such as renewable energy or forestry initiatives. Contribution to
overall emission reduction efforts by blockchain projects is now very limited
area. However, as web3 builders and environmentalists, I believe that we should
take the responsibility to voice out about these topics in the web3 ecosystem

💪

Decentralization and Scalability Promotion
Promoting a distributed architecture is critical to lower energy usage and carbon
emissions. Blockchain systems can allow more users to participate in mining by
avoiding the concentration of mining power in energy-intensive places, lowering
total energy consumption per participant and accompanying carbon emissions.
It will also be beneficial for environmental impact to draw attention to the
fundamental 2 solution concepts such as off-chain transaction implementation
and layer2 scaling solutions in the web3 ecosystem.

Decentralization and Scalability Promotion
All the solutions I mentioned above are actually a product of research and
innovation. For this reason, no matter which sector or project, it should have a
structure that is open to researchers and innovations. I believe it is necessary,
especially for the web3 ecosystem where we have the opportunity to learn
something every day.
107

Continuous research and innovation are essential for developing innovative
ways to lower blockchain technology’s environmental impact. Exploring
alternate consensus algorithms, creating more efficient mining processes, and
refining blockchain protocols to reduce energy requirements while retaining
security and decentralization are all part of this effort.

Conclusion
Whether related to blockchain technology or not, environmental impacts are
still a significant problem for any industry. Unfortunately, blockchain
technology also has a large share of these impacts.
The solutions I mentioned are based only on research and research-based
foresight. Hopefully, solutions that will minimize environmental impacts will be
implemented in all industries, especially web3 and crypto, as soon as possible.

Nigeria's Independent Electric Power Distribution

Nigeria's Independent
Electric Power
Distribution
DecentralizedCEO

109

Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," is a nation filled with rich
cultural heritage, vibrant communities, and vast potential. However, the
availability and accessibility of electric power have been long standing
challenges that hinder progress and development. The transformational impact
of electricity in improving lives, fostering economic growth, and enhancing
quality of life cannot be overstated. To address this pressing need, a paradigm
shift towards utilizing community resources to provide and distribute electric
power, independent of government aid, is gaining momentum. Tag along as we
explore the opportunities and importance of such an approach, and the positive
implications it holds for Nigeria's public and private sectors.
There are many benefits of electric power. Electricity is the lifeblood of modern
society, and its benefits are immeasurable. It brings warmth, comfort, and
security to households, enabling families to thrive and children to study in welllit environments. Access to reliable electric power transforms businesses,
driving productivity, innovation, and job creation. It powers healthcare
facilities, ensuring timely medical services and the preservation of life.
Moreover, electricity unlocks new opportunities in the digital age, connecting
communities to information, education, and global markets.

110

However, with all these benefits, there are visible challenges in Nigeria's electric
infrastructure specifically. Historically, Nigeria has faced numerous challenges
in its electric infrastructure, including inadequate generation capacity,
inefficient transmission systems, and high distribution losses. These issues have
resulted in widespread power outages and limited access to electricity,
particularly in rural areas. The burden on the government to address this
colossal problem has been immense, and progress has been slower than desired
due to financial constraints and bureaucratic challenges.
Due to the ongoing issues in the system for many years, Nigeria has passed The
Electricity Bill of 2023 which could be a turning point. In a remarkable step
towards empowering communities, the Nigerian government passed the
Electricity Bill of 2023, marking a significant turning point in the nation's
energy landscape. This legislation paves the way for increased private sector
participation, public-private partnerships, and the utilization of community
resources to generate and distribute electricity. By allowing local communities
to take charge of their energy needs, the Electricity Bill of 2023 creates an
enabling environment for innovation, collaboration, and sustainable solutions.
The shift towards community-driven electric power distribution offers
unprecedented opportunities. It empowers communities to leverage their own
resources, such as solar, wind, or hydro power, to generate electricity. This
approach not only reduces dependence on centralized power grids but also
promotes energy diversification and resilience. Furthermore, it enables the
private sector to invest in localized energy projects, creating jobs, stimulating
economic growth, and fostering innovation.

111

By encouraging public-private partnerships, the Electricity Bill of 2023 enables
the pooling of resources, expertise, and technology to address Nigeria's energy
challenges effectively. The private sector brings efficiency, innovation, and
capital, while the government ensures regulatory oversight and supports
infrastructure development. Together, these collaborations can drive the rapid
expansion of electricity access and improve the quality and reliability of power
supply across the nation.
This also drives the notion of community ownership and sustainability. One of
the most promising aspects of community-driven electric power distribution is
the concept of community ownership. When communities have a stake in their
energy systems, they become actively engaged in their management,
maintenance, and sustainability. This sense of ownership fosters pride,
encourages responsible energy consumption, and promotes long-term
community development.

112

Moreover, community-based energy projects can be designed with
sustainability in mind. Embracing renewable energy sources reduces
greenhouse gas emissions, mitigates the environmental impact of traditional
energy generation, and contributes to Nigeria's commitment to combating
climate change. Communities can harness their abundant solar resources, for
example, to establish microgrids, ensuring clean and reliable power even in
remote areas.

In short, The Electricity Bill of 2023 represents a landmark opportunity for
Nigeria to address its long-standing challenges in electric power distribution. By
harnessing community resources and promoting public-private partnerships,
the nation can unlock immense potential for sustainable development,
economic growth, and improved quality of life. Community-driven energy
initiatives not only provide reliable electricity but also empower local
communities, foster job creation, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
With collective effort and strategic collaboration, Nigeria can embark on a
transformative journey towards a brighter and electrified future for all its
citizens.

What is an intentional
community? And why
you should start one
today.
beeradley

114

After spending the last year travelling through Central America spending time
with intentional communities and projects, landing in New York City hit like a
ton of bricks.
Sitting in a cafe in Lower Manhattan writing this, I decided to ask the waiter
“Hey, what do you think an Intentional Community is?”
I was certain she’d say something like “oh, it’s a bunch of hippies living deep in
the forest, eating mushrooms, growing their own food and disconnecting from
society”.
But her answer was so simple and so spot on, I was shocked.
“An intentional community is just a community with an intention”.

What is an Intentional Community?
What comes to mind when you hear the words ‘Intentional Community’?
An intention is a clear purpose that guides behaviour.
A community is a collection of humans.
So an intentional community is any collection of humans with a shared,
clear purpose that guides the groups behaviour.
It really is that simple.
An intentional community doesn’t have to be a self-sufficient eco village in the
jungles of Central America.
It could be a co-living experiment in Oakland, like Radish, or a network of
connected residencies for online workers across the globe, like Cabin.city.
115

It could be a weekly mushroom micro-dosing dance gathering in Mexico City.
Hell, it could even be your nans knitting club at your local services centre.
A little over a year ago when we started our journey to better understand
intentional communities, the plan was simple.
We’d visit a bunch of intentional communities around the world, learn the
secrets and the failures.
Then, with our gained wisdom, we’d return to Australia, buy some land, get a
few friends involved, build some dwellings and walla! Job done.

An image of us helping with the construction of a new Cabin in Austin Texas with the amazing
Cabin.city

As it turns out, starting a village-scale residential community is hard. Very hard.
And it’s not hard for the financial or legal reasons.
It’s hard because humans are weird social creatures with complex, unresolved
mummy and daddy issues.
116

Out of every ten intentional communities of the larger village scale, only one
actually makes it. The other nine? They implode in a fireball of conflict,
heartbreak and lawsuit (sometimes all three).
Diane Christian’s Creating a Life Together is the go-to resource for anyone
considering creating a village scale intentional community.
After highlighting the disturbing failure rate of intentional communities
through years of research, Diane offers a an amazing resource to help those
wishing to undertake the community creation task.
Here is a snippet talking through structural conflict and how to avoid it.
Six steps to avoid structural conflict:
Identify your community vision and create vision documents
Choose a fair, participatory decision-making process appropriate for your
group. And if you choose consensus, get trained in it.
Make clear agreements — in writing. (This includes choosing an appropriate
legal entity for owning land together).
Learn good communication and group process skills. Make clear
communication and resolving conflicts a priority.
In choosing cofounders and new members, select for emotional maturity.
Learn the head skills and heart skills you need to know.
From Creating a Life Together (p. 8): Christian, Diana Leafe. New Society
Publishers.

117

Why you should start an Intentional Community
today
After diving into Diane’s research and visiting some of the larger scale ecovillage communities in Central America, the once lofty dream of creating a
residential community in Australia came crashing down.

The daily activity board @ Pachamama eco-village and retreat centre in Costa Rica

I certainly wasn’t prepared or qualified to dedicate my life co-ordinating a group
of potential community residents through structural conflict workshops
118

So you might be wondering why I am encouraging you to start an intentional
community?
The general consensus is that starting a village scale residential community
without first creating community cohesion is a recipe for disaster.
While most folks won’t be selling all their belongings and moving to a remote
Hare Krishna village in the Panamanian jungle, starting a small, non-residential
intentional community project is well within reach.
There is also a strong case to be made that a smaller intentional community
project or experiment should be created and developed as a foundation before a
larger village-scale community venture.
Even if you have no desire to live in an intentional community, everyone should
be part of at least one intentional community gathering.
And I’m not referring to your local football club, cross-fit academy or art
workshop.
I’m talking about a community that fosters daily connection.
Where each member connects with and contributes meaningfully to an
intention and vision bigger than themselves.
There are endless reasons to start an Intentional Community.
Let’s start with the blatantly obvious.
Humans are supposed to live in close community with other humans beyond
their immediate family!

119

Community offers a healthy support network and a zillion other benefits. We
are happiest and healthiest surrounded by people we love and admire. This is
the “obvious truth”
Humans are lonely.
Improving technology makes us feel more connected, but the harsh reality is we
are more lonely than ever. Loneliness is an epidemic.
Humans are living through strange times.
Economic uncertainty, political instability, impeding AI takeover. Building
strong community networks and learning to be more sovereign in all aspects of
life has never been more important

Why is there such a lack of intentional community
gathering?
Given all of the benefits, why aren’t there more intentional community
gatherings?
Starting an intentional community project is far less risky than creating a
village-scale residential community, but it’s certainly not easy.
It takes time, effort, vulnerability and a good deal of thinking outside the box.
Once upon a time we needed thriving community to survive.
To maintain your place within a community, you needed to contribute
meaningfully.

120

Not part of a community? Dead.
Banished from your community? Starve, then dead.
Today, we no longer have these concerns.
Not part of a community? Facebook.
Banished from your community? Uber eats, then Facebook.
If we’re being completely honest with ourselves, most of us live within the
oppressive cocoon of our cushy twentieth Century.
We are living without the required healthy dose of community.
We have Amazon, Social Media, Netflix, there is hardly a reason to leave the
couch. Most of us don’t even know the names of our neighbors.
We maintain half arsed relationship circles, spend most of our interaction time
in shallow, uninspiring conversation with coworkers we don’t know or like.
And then (if we’re lucky), we invest whatever time we have leftover to actually
do things we love with people we love.
This is backwards.

121

How to start an intentional community
We’ve covered the what and the why, next we’ll discuss the how.
A wise waitress once told me “an intentional community is a community with an
intention”.
There is no one-size-fits-all-approach.
Your intentional community doesn’t need to be a huge and grand undertaking,
but it does need to be intentional.
And there are two big ideas, executed well will give your intentional community
in the best chance at success.

Intention and value alignment by design
In other words, rather than hoping (or forcing) members of your community to
align on intention and values, connect and meaningfully contribute, you can
design your community to take care of this for you. As Jackson Steger from
Cabin.City likes to say “don’t hope for connection between residents - engineer
it.”

Revisiting ritual and ceremony
Luckily, we can draw upon collective and preserved knowledge of the OG
community builders. Indigenous, first nations people around the world have
practiced complex ritual and ceremony designed to ensure intention and value
alignment for thousands of years. Accessing, adapting and using these practices
is the healthy intentional community hack.
We’ll explore these two ideas further over the next two pieces of writing.

How a Regen Survives
the Urban Apocalypse

Sarah Baxendell

123

Climate change is real.
Despite your best efforts, some of you are going to die.

Every tactic in this guide has been used during a catastrophic climate change event.
Instructions, photographs, and practical anecdotes come from real world experience,
including Occupy Wall Street Sustainability Working Group and hurricane recovery during
Hurricane Katrina (New Orleans, Louisiana) and Hurricane Sandy (NYC metro area).

124

Survival Step 1: Gather, Store, and Clean Water
Apocalypse Scenario: There are no longer municipal water treatment plants or
water systems pumping clean water to your kitchen on the fifth floor. You need a
way to gather and store water efficiently. You also need a way to clean used
water, in place, so that you can re-use it for household activities.

Urban Water Reclamation - It’s time to install a rain
barrel
What is a rain barrel and why do I need one? Rain barrels are a simple way to
collect and store rainwater runoff from your roof, which is typically less
contaminated than used water or river water, and considered a relatively safe
water source.
Supplies:
Rain barrel, or any large, enclosed container
Gutters to funnel rainwater from the roof
Downspout or reusable pipe to direct water into the container
Instructions to Build:
Step 1: Find a level surface near an existing downspout to place the enclosed
container. Set the container on a sturdy base, like bricks, cinder blocks, or a
stand.
Step 2: Prepare the downspout - cut a few inches about the enclosed container’s
inlet hole.
Step 3: Install the diverter - one end should connect to the downspout, and the
other should connect to the container’s inlet hole. The diverter allows you to
redirect the water flow into the barrel when it’s not full and bypass it when it is.
125

Instructions to Maintain: Regularly inspect the container for debris. Keep the
lid securely fastened to prevent mosquito breeding. Empty the container prior to
freezing temperature to avoid damage from freezing water.

Graywater Systems - It’s time to clean your used water
What is a graywater system? A graywater system is a method of cleaning used
water in order to reuse it for domestic activities like bathing, washing hands,
and laundry, ie. purposes that don't require drinkable (potable) water. Before
reuse, graywater needs some level of treatment, ranging from basic filtering to
more advanced processing, to remove debris, hair, soap, and contaminants.
What is the basis of the design? The initial biofilter basin contains wood
chips, which have a large surface area so that bacteria can degrade organic
nutrients (fats and soaps) in the used water. Once the water filters through the
biofilter, it comes out of the bottom of the initial basin and flows into a
secondary basin which is planted with water-loving plants. It flows through this
basin in a subsurface pipe which distributes the greywater into the soil strata.
The water-loving plant roots are surrounded by bacteria which act as a biofilter,
cleaning the water. The plant roots utilize the nitrogen and phosphorus in the
water as a food source. For cleaner, clearer water, run water through the system
multiple times.
How do I build a graywater system? This design is simple to execute, and
could be made with found materials. If “water-loving” plants aren’t available in
the apocalypse, other plant types could be used, as long as they naturally grow in
areas that receive frequent rain (ie. no, a cactus is not appropriate for this
design).

126

Instructions to Build:
Supplies: rain barrels, woodchips, gravel, water-loving plants
Instructions to Use:
Step 1: Soapy used water is poured through wood chips.
Step 2: Plants absorb nutrients and phosphorus.
Step 3: Water overflows into a bucket, which is cleaner, and can be reused!
Water can be run through the system multiple times for a cleaner, clearer result.
Instructions to Maintain: Once the wood chips in the biofilter have become
inundated and unable to process the graywater, you will have to remove them
and replace them with new wood chips.

Survival Step 2: Become your own electricity source
Apocalypse Scenario: There is no electricity any more. The power plants
melted down months ago. You need to become your own power source, and
quickly.

Pedal Power- It’s time to build a bicycle generator
What is a bicycle generator system? A bicycle generator system, also known
as a pedal-powered generator, is a device that converts human pedal power from
a bicycle into electrical energy. It allows individuals to generate electricity by
pedaling a stationary bicycle or an attachment to a regular bicycle.
The basic components of a bicycle generator system typically include:
Bicycle: a regular or stationary bicycle serves as a the primary means of
generating power
Generator: the core component responsible for converting mechanical
energy from pedaling into electrical energy. It typically contains a small
motor connected to the bike’s wheels or pedals, which acts as a dynamo or
alternator.
Wiring: connect the generator to various electrical components, such as
batteries, to store and use the generated electricity.
Battery (optional, but recommended): store the generated electrical
energy for when you are not actively pedaling
Power Outlet and Converter: used to power small electronic devices or
small appliances, and charge batteries

129

1. Instructions to Build:

Supplies: Generator Diode, Terminal Board, Fuse holder, Fuse, Charge
Controller, Watts Up Meter, Battery, DC Outlet, DC Port, Inverter Box

130

Occupy Wall Street Energy Bikes were designed and built by volunteers to power
critical infrastructure such as media, medical, and the library. These bikes,
powering deep cell batteries, were the source of 100% of all energy used at Zuccotti
Park. A collaboration of TimesUp!, MIT PedalPower, PedalPowerNYC, Occupy
Boston, and Brooklyn Machine Works.

Survival Step 3: What to do with all that human shit?
Apocalypse Scenario: The sanitation plant broke down. Flushing your toilet
requires water, and the pipes are no longer working, so if you use your toilet, the
shit just backs up into your bathroom. Gross.
What is a humanure system? A humanure system composts human waste
(feces and urine) and recycles it into nutrient-rich compost, which can be used in
gardening. Humanure systems close the nutrient loop and reduce
environmental pollution caused by traditional sewage systems. Rather than
flushing human waste into a centralized wastewater treatment facility or
releasing it untreated into water bodies, humanure systems treat and process
the waste locally.
Supplies: bucket and sawdust, wood chips, straw or leaves

131

How do I build and use a humanure system?
Step 1: Collect human waste in a composting toilet (ie a bucket), separating feces
and urine to minimize odors.
Step 2: Add materials like sawdust, wood chips, straw or leaves after each toilet
use, to balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. These materials act as a bulking
agent and create the conditions for composting to naturally occur.
Step 3: Once the container is full, it should be emptied into a large composting
pile. The composting process will naturally break down organic matter via
microorganisms, which require oxygen, moisture, and the right carbon-tonitrogen ratio.
Step 4: The compost is left to age and mature for at least one year to ensure that
any pathogens in the human waste are completely eliminated. Once properly
composted humanure is safe to use in the garden as it becomes rich, fertile, and
pathogen-free soil.

Survival Step 4: Transform food waste
Apocalypse Scenario: All your food scraps can no longer be hauled away, as
there are no trash services. While you have a compost pile outside, it’s attracting
rats. You need a way to compost more quickly, easily, and safely to expand your
garden and grow food.
What is bokashi fermentation? Bokashi fermentation is a type of anaerobic
composting that originated in Japan. It uses beneficial microbes to break down
organic matter into nutrient-rich compost. Bokashi can handle a wider variety
of organic materials than typical compost systems, including meat, dairy and
bones. It is faster than traditional composting, taking only a few weeks to
complete. It can be done indoors and is useful for households with limited
outdoor space or access to a traditional compost pile.
132

Supplies: a bucket with a tight lid, food waste, bokashi bran
How do I build and use a bokashi fermentation system?
Step 1: Bokashi fermentation begins with a special inoculated bran or sawdust
mix that contains a group of beneficial microorganisms, including lactic acid
bacteria, yeast, and phototrophic bacteria, which are responsible for the
fermentation process. Dust the bottom of your bucket with the bran.
Step 2: Collect kitchen scraps into your bucket.
Step 3: Place a layer of bokashi bran between each layer of compost.
Step 4: Compact the contents of your bucket, seal it airtight, and keep it in a
cool, dark place for 2+ weeks. During this time the beneficial microorganisms
break down the organic matter producing liquid byproducts known as “bokashi
juice.”
Step 5: After the fermentation is complete, the bokashi compost is not fully
decomposed. It should be buried in a ditch in the ground and covered with
natural soil, or added to a compost bin for further decomposition. This predigested organic matter makes it easier and faster to convert into nutrient-rich
compost.
How do I create my own bokashi bran?
Ingredients:
Wheat bran or rice bran, 5 cups
Molasses or brown sugar, ½ cup
Water, 1 cup
Effective Microorganisms (EM), 1 tablespoon

133

Equipment:
Large mixing bowl
Air-tight container or ziplock bag for storing the finished bokashi bran
Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the wheat bran or rice bran with the
molasses or brown sugar. Mix them thoroughly to ensure even distribution.
2. In a separate container, mix the EM with water to activate it.
3. Gradually add the activated EM solution to the bran mixture while stirring
continuously. The goal is to moisten the bran without creating a soggy
consistency.
4. Once the bran is evenly coated, spread it out on a clean surface, like a baking
sheet, to dry. You can place it in a well ventilated area or under the sun. Stir
it occasionally to ensure it dries uniformly.
5. Allow the bran to dry completely, which may take a few days. Once it is dry,
store it in an airtight container, and keep it in a cool dry place.

Lessons Learned from
the Boulder Blockchain
Meetup
Michael Green

135

Format:
We meet once per month and sit around talking for ~1.25 hours, then we have a
scheduled move to a local bar a few blocks away. This provides a more casual
atmosphere where people can follow up on discussion topics and network a bit
more.
We start each meetup by giving attendees a chance to introduce themselves,
suggest one or two topics to discuss and/or upvote topics others have provided.
The meetup organizer keeps track of interest in the topics and starts the
conversation by picking the most popular subject to discuss. The moderator
doesn’t need to have any expertise in the topic themselves, and can start the
convo by asking a basic question related to the topic EG: “Why is X interesting to
you?”
During the conversation, there are usually a lot of acronyms that get used and
some folks might not know what they mean. To make the meetup more
inclusive, the organizer can jump in from time to time to ask the speaker to
explain what something means, which ensures folks have a better chance of
following along. If there is a lull in the discussion on a specific topic, that’s a
good cue to move on to the next most popular topic. The organizer is present to
keep the conversation moving, not to decide what to talk about. Keep it simple to
participate, and allow the group to dictate the direction of the conversation.
At the end of the meetup we give about 5 minutes for members to announce any
local events related to the meetup subject matter that others may be interested
in. This provides an opportunity for people to organically discover things they
may have otherwise not discovered.

136

Discussion Logistics:
As an organizer of the meetup, you need to be comfortable interrupting the
conversation from time to time in order to keep the meetup productive and on
track.
The above format works great for up to ~30 meetup attendees. If there are more
than 30 attendees it is very helpful to split the attendees into groups. This can be
an organic process based on subject interest or the moderator can pick who goes
where. When splitting into groups, it is important to designate an attendee as a
moderator of that group. This ensures the conversation stays focused and
attendees get value from it. When choosing someone to moderate, do your best
to ensure they are someone trustworthy. During the bull market grifters
occasionally show up and try to shill their bags and or take advantage of other
attendees. Usually picking a regular attendee/someone you know & trust as a
moderator is the best bet.
When the meetups were really popular in 2017 we would sometimes get up to 50
attendees. We found it useful to create a separate group for beginners. These
would be led by a volunteer attendee of the meetup. Again, it is important to
choose someone knowledgeable & trustworthy to lead this group.
Sometimes an attendee may end up dominating a conversation/dragging out a
topic for too long and the moderator may have to jump in to move things on.
Providing this guidance should be done gently. An easy way to handle this
situation is to suggest continuing the conversation after the meetup.
Occasionally there may be intense debate on a topic and the moderator may
have to jump in to diffuse the situation. This can usually be handled by
suggesting to continue the conversation after the meetup.

137

If there is a lot of enthusiasm for one topic, it can be easy to get caught up talking
about that one thing for a very long time. This should be avoided, especially
when there is a long list of other topics folks want to discuss. A good rule of
thumb is to limit discussion on one topic to less than 30 minutes. As above, the
best way to move on to the next topic is to suggest that the conversation
continues after the meetup. Limiting topics to 30 minutes or less, provides for
more diversity in the meetup subject matter and keeps it relevant to more
people.

Venue logistics:
One of the biggest factors for a successful meetup is consistency. Holding the
meetup at the same time (6pm on the 2nd Tuesday of every month etc) & place,
makes it much easier for people to plan around.
Finding & maintaining a venue for the meetup can sometimes be challenging.
One way to find a venue is to look for a company/project in the community that
has a suitable space and would benefit from exposure to the meetup group. This
can be as broad as a co-working space that would want to have attendees get
memberships to their space, or could be as narrow as a project that is looking to
hire talent from the industry the meetup is focused on. The easiest way to find
these connections is to reach out to members of the existing meetup community
if it exists.
If you host the meetup at a location that is provided by a company/project it is
important to make sure you give the host proper acknowledgement for
providing the space and give them a moment to shill their project, or shill it for
them. It is also important to encourage the group to publicly express their
gratitude to whoever is contributing the space by clapping for them after their
project/company has been shilled. The same is true for any company/project
that is providing food or drinks for the meetup.

138

If you are bootstrapping a meetup community and are having trouble finding a
venue, local libraries often have space that can be used free of charge. If it is nice
outside you can also meet up at a local park. We have found that having meetups in
bars or restaurants isn’t conducive to great conversations because they tend to be
noisy and distracting and often don’t have enough space to accommodate the
meetup.

Venue logistics:
We post all of our scheduled meetups to meetup.com. This makes it discoverable to
those who are looking for meetups based on a particular topic. Using meetup.com
also makes it easy for existing meetup members to know when the meetup is
happening because it is easily accessible and will even send members event
reminder emails.
In addition to the Meetup.com page, we have a telegram group people can join to
stay updated on monthly meetups and other community events. We would send
out an email reminder and a Telegram Channel post to everyone the Sunday before
our Tuesday meetup to remind everyone of the time/location/and suggestion to
come with a few topics to discuss.

Precious Plastic
Commons

fcarva

140

As part of Precious Plastic Espírito Santo and working daily with plastic waste, a
project that connects plastic recycling to web3, blockchain has always popped
up in my mind
Precious Plastic has applied for the Commons Prize at Common Stock for a
collaboration with the potential to create a DAO. If you want to see the project
and the discussion, you can visit the github.
DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a form of organization where
decisions are collectively and decentralizedly made using smart contracts and
blockchain to automate and record transactions, as well as incorporate
governance processes and tokens.
I believe we can build a decentralized plastic recycling system by creating
coordination games to encourage people to handle their waste better.
Take advantage of web3:
- Global
- Transparent
- unchanging
- programmable finance
New engine designs based on game theory, implemented for decentralized
blockchain networks as open-source and transparent code

Open-source: Plastic Recycling Hardware
Precious Plastic is an open-source hardware project that empowers people to
start their own recycling businesses. It provides knowledge about plastic, its
types, machine know-how, collection points, and the entire universe of recycled
plastic.
141

Over the course of 10 years, one of Precious Plastic’s greatest achievements for
the global community has been the translation of complex recycling and
engineering concepts into accessible knowledge and information that anyone
can replicate and build locally.
The “how-to” guides consist of tutorials created by the community for the
community, offering freely available and ranked products, tips, and methods
based on their importance.

They have designed and developed plastic recycling machines that are shared
online, allowing people around the world to suggest, comment, and start
replicating and building these machines locally.

142

The goal of Precious Plastic is to enable as many people as possible to start
recycling, whether by providing information on how to do it or by connecting
them with others in their local communities to tackle the plastic waste problem.

143

In addition to machine development, Precious Plastic has a platform and a
community on Discord that facilitates and promotes collaboration and
community building.
On the Bazar, you can find products sold by the community, making it easier to
access the best products created worldwide.

Impact in 2023
The Precious Plastic Impact Report for 2023 provides a summary of the report’s
key points. You can view the full report here:
107 countries
595,400 tons recycled in 2022
Over $36 million in revenue
6,441 employees
11,510 volunteers
1,881 machines built in 2022

The Plastic Problem

Precious plastic site: Academy, plastic Intro.
Precious Plastic is often known for freely sharing information and being an opensource project.
Precious Plastic faces the challenge of the tragedy of the commons, where many
users benefit from their resources but struggle to contribute to the underlying
protocol.
Currently, there is a disincentive for individuals to contribute to Precious Plastic.
If someone develops a new machine or mold, they are more likely to sell it rather
than share it with the community.
This problem hampers the potential for growth and the impact that could be
generated.

145

Blockchain and Plastic Waste
Precious Plastic’s application to Common Stack and the decentralized eyewear
produced by DCS Nouns, a group of producers that fund their ideas for the Nouns
ecosystem.
The integration of Precious Plastic into the blockchain would be a way to reverse
and align individual incentives with the project’s interests.
Blockchain technology, governance through a DAO, and crypt
oeconomics can generate coordination incentives for significant contributions and
promote community growth.
“By transferring ownership and governance from the core team to the
community, individuals recycling plastic around the world can have a stake in
Precious Plastic’s success. As the project thrives, their stake increases,
providing a powerful incentive to contribute back to the community.”
The transition from a web 2 open-source project that has already helped thousands
of people worldwide start recycling to blockchain and web3 technologies presents
unique challenges and immense potential.
Plastic pollution generates a range of negative externalities. Regeneration projects
need to exist, be funded, and grow. Precious Plastic can play a crucial role by
simplifying language and concepts into simple and understandable ideas that
anyone can grasp regarding the potential of blockchain to address coordination
failures.
Therefore, we face problems like free-riders who benefit from and utilize opensource technology without contributing or generating incentives back to the
community, as well as the difficulty of funding a project that serves as a public
good, lacking profitability without community or public support.

146

Although it is a project that has not yet been initiated, Precious Plastic Commons is
an interesting initiative for a protocol that directly addresses the plastic waste
problem in a decentralized manner. It could gather global-level information and
knowledge within a community where proposals can be written and shared to
encourage local recycling microenterprises. Governance processes and tokens, as
seen in DAOs, would enable coordination among projects working with plastic
waste and its community.
