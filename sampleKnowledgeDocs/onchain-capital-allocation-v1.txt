CAPITAL ALLOCATION
THE NEXT FRONTIER
Capital allocation is a simple concept: it’s the act of deciding how to distribute funding
or resources. If you’ve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a meal, you’ve allocated
capital.

BY KEVIN OWOCKI

Capital allocation can become a full time job: governments and grant-making organizations spend vast amounts of time and money figuring out the process, logistics, and
decision-making involved in allocating capital. At scale, capital allocation inevitably becomes mired in gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of transparency and
accountability.

ONCHAIN CAPITAL ALLOCATION
HANDBOOK

Crypto with its programmable smart contracts, present incredible advantages towards
allocating capital in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.
The internet revolutionized how information was distributed in society. If crypto succeeds
in revolutionizing how society distributes scarce resources, it follows that it will upend,
and improve, how we do capital allocation.

A PRACTICAL JOURNEY FROM PRESENT MECHANISMS TO FUTURE POSSIBILITIES

The next horizon is hard to see alone, but by exploring it together, we can grasp it.
This book is a celebration of the design space, and your no-hype resource to understanding the emergent pluralistic ecology of capital allocation developing in the web3 space.
I’ve enjoyed putting together this handbook of the latest and greatest in what’s possible.
It is my great pleasure to have a front row seat to this movement as a member of Gitcoin.
My hope for this book is that I can pay it forward to you.

ONCHAIN CAPITAL ALLOCATION HANDBOOK

What if we could solve coordination failures with capital allocation? What if we could
create better, more sovereign, collective action? How might we bring centuries old capital
allocation strategies onchain? Can we invent new onchain capital allocation strategies

IT’S SPRINGTIME
FOR ONCHAIN
COORDINATION
Crypto, with its programmable smart contracts and
properties of trustlessness and tamper resistance,
presents incredible advantages towards allocating
capital in an efficient, effective, democratic, and transparent manner.
Since these systems are built open source, we can all
learn from them or even fork them when we want to
use or improve them. The result is a rapidly evolving
multiplayer exploration of the design space that compounds and accelerates exponentially over time.
The old world is decaying and a new world is sprouting.
We are in a springtime of onchain coordination. What a
moment to be alive!
It is my great pleasure to have a front-row seat to this
moment as a co-founder of Gitcoin and host of the
Greenpill Podcast. My gift to you is paying it forward
through this book and it’s digital community. This book
is a labour of love & a celebration of this design space.
I’ve put countless hours of research, networking, weaving, and writing into this handbook to give a reader a
peek into the latest and greatest in what’s possible. The
next horizon is hard to see alone, but by exploring it together & sharing our findings we will discover it faster
and more effectively traverse its cartography.
You will notice that the mechanisms featured in this
book are visualized as though they are ecological net-

works. This is not an accident. I believe that tending
to communities is like tending to a garden.
Just as organisms in a garden require sun, fertile
ground, water, and nutrients, open-source communities require care, tending, data, and financial
resources. Just as different nutrients can change
the expression of a flower, different approaches to
capital allocation can change how onchain communities express themselves.
While a primary lense through which I study the
space is through Gitcoin, this book goes way beyond
Gitcoin’s ambitions or roadmap. Given the volume of
grants we’ve managed, Gitcoin is a significant vehicle
for me to explore the space. However, our vantage
point is limited, and our primary mechanisms as of
2024 (QF, RetroPGF) are just scratching the surface
of the possibilities. In places where I mention Gitcoin,
I have gone to lengths to do so as a vehicle for creating understanding for the reader of the design space
(shilling Gitcoin is only secondary).
The book is not designed to be consumed strictly
linearly. While I have laid out the chapters in a way
that provides a reader with an end-to-end download
of my vision, I invite you to jump around the book
and follow your interests. Just as a hiker uses a field
guide to identify organisms, you can use this book as
your field guide as you explore this frontier of web3.
As you dive in,
note that there are
two types of chapters
in this book.

Mechanism chapters

strategies and what they’re
good at.

Gives context for how to think
about the patterns or space in

These two types of content are designed to complement one another.

As you explore this design space, I invite you to
envision an emergent pluralistic ecology of capital
allocation mechanisms. Each excels at one thing, but
together they create a diverse tapestry of effective
capital allocation for the entire web3 space. This
book is your guide to progressive elaboration of this
ecosystem!
And it gets better. We are not only mapping this
design space; we are manifesting it. We are in an
strange loop of (1) discovering & (2) creating this
beautiful design space. By following this strange
loop recursively, we are memeing a pluralistic ecology of capital allocation mechanisms into existence.
The infinite garden grows & thrives the more we
tend to it.
I believe that we will see these onchain coordination
networks increase in usefulness and proliferate into
many places in the web3 ecosystem (and eventually in the real world) in the coming years. While
I’ve attempted to make this book timeless, some of
its content will invariably become dated given how
fast the space evolves. If you wish to continue the
discussion, feel free to join the Telegram group of
readers of this book. Maybe we can create a second
edition (or translate it to new languages) together in
the coming years.

META

ONCHAIN CAPITAL
ALLOCATION

Capital allocation is a simple concept: it’s the act of
deciding how to distribute funding or resources. If
you’ve ever paid bills, taxes, or repaid friends for a
meal, you’ve allocated capital.
Capital allocation is a task for most individuals but a
full-time job for many: governments and grant-making organizations spend vast amounts of time and
money figuring out the process, logistics, and
decision-making involved in allocating capital. At
scale, capital allocation inevitably becomes mired in
gatekeeping, rivalrous decision making, and lack of
transparency and accountability.
Blockchain and crypto, with their programmable
smart contracts, present novel opportunities in (1)
accumulating (2) allocating & (3) distributing capital
in an efficient, effective, and transparent manner.
Gitcoin has seized this advantage by moving the
entirety of our grants program onchain:

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

13

from governance, creation, management, and
disbursement. Moving the grants program onchain
and it being open source also allows us to build a
network of developers, grants programs, and capital
allocators in web3 – all of which ultimately benefit
the Gitcoin ecosystem.
Gitcoin has previously experimented deeply with a
few forms of grantmaking, primarily focused on fair
and effective ways to implement Quadratic Funding.
We’ve created a market for this grants mechanism
and scaled it from $0 to $millions distributed per
year. We’re now starting to see traction with new
mechanisms, like Direct Grants and Retro PGF, and
are poised to scale those as well.
The crypto ecosystem has funded over $1B across
5,900 grants and is continuing to scale to support
blockchain’s enormous growth goals. The potential
of capital allocation extends beyond grants and
represents a game-changing category that Gitcoin
and its extended network of partners and protocol
builders is poised to help accelerate. Our north
star of funding $1B in grants is both an aggressive
growth target for Gitcoin, and only the start of what’s
possible.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION:
THE NEXT GROWTH
FRONTIER
One of the most recognizable forms of capital
allocation is government spending. It also perfectly
depicts many of the limitations of traditional capital
allocation.

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

14

LEGACY CAPITAL
ALLOCATION
Governments accumulate funds through levying
taxes – something each citizen is obligated to participate in. The funds collected are, in theory, spent
in order to benefit the collective group of taxpayers.
This system also illustrates many of the problems
that traditional capital allocation methodologies
suffer from:

GATEKEEPING

NOT SCALABLE

NOT PRECISE

Small groups of decision makers, who may become power
brokers, and are unwilling or
unable to be democratic.

Not taking advantage of the
primitives the internet (easy
access, direct to consumer
interfaces) and Ethereum
(credible neutrality, composability, transparency, democratic decision making, censorship
resistance) have to offer.

Without the ability to
programmatically manage
large amounts of information
at scale, they are not able
to precisely allocate capital
resources.

Over the past 30 years, advancements in technology
have created opportunities to solve previously intractable problems of capital allocation. The internet
has introduced the ability to communicate at a scale
that was formerly infeasible.
Blockchains have created a transparent ledger to report on activities and create accountability through
easy data availability and the immutability of onchain
actions. By combining internet-speed innovation and

15

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

blockchain-level transparency, we will unlock a new
frontier of capital allocation – one where communities can fund what matters to them in ways that
are not only more effective, but also more aligned to
their values.

ETHEREUM-BASED
CAPITAL ALLOCATION
CAN BE:
Accessible

Democratic

Anyone with an internet
connection can participate
through web or mobile applications.

The ability to easily create and
run onchain voting enables
governance that reflects the
will of the people.

Evolutionary

Incorruptable

Anyone working with open
source software can easily fork
and modify existing methods
to evolve according to their
own needs.

Leveraging blockchain’s core
feature of an incorruptible
public ledger, with audit trails
available to anyone.

Transparent

Precise & Scalable

Using programmable smart
contracts able to precisely
allocate resources at scale.

The mechanisms invented
in web3 can scale with high
levels of precision.

The time to solve the problems of capital allocation
is now. We can build capital allocation systems that
solve the constraints noted above. We can remove
barriers to adoption by emphasizing the transparency and extensibility of these systems. We can build

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

16

more effective, efficient or novel capital allocation
methodologies by using democratic voting and creating accessible systems of participation.

ONCHAIN CAPITAL
ALLOCATION
Today in web3, there are hundreds of DAOs with
$millions of capital to distribute to fund growth in
their ecosystems. These DAOs have unlocked new
global markets to turn ideas and APIs into products
and adoption so much faster than before.
Gitcoin is positioned to help stimulate the creation
of this new category of capital allocation, building on
the success of Quadratic Funding and web3 grants.
Through its grants program, Gitcoin has more experience with onchain capital allocation than anyone
else. We believe in the potential so strongly that we
spent two years architecting a protocol and product
suite that will easily allow anyone in web3 to participate in new methods of capital allocation.

GITCOIN STATS

We believe the impact and reach of next-generation
capital allocation will be felt across many industries – from web3 social and marketing to traditional
industries like crowdfunding, real estate, scientific

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

17

research, and more. Next-generation capital allocation represents not just a technological evolution,
but an evolution in our social practices around how
we organize, exercise buying power, and own assets.
While Gitcoin’s initial focus is on grant-making for
DAOs and other tokenized communities, we believe
that as more assets become tokenized in various
industries, a wide open design space will emerge
to reimagine how capital allocation is done. These
industries include but are not limited to:

WHO NEEDS CAPITAL
ALLOCATION?
Environmental
& Social Impact

City, Country and
State Development
projects

Capital
Formation
and Economic
Growth

Philanthropic
Initiatives

Scientific
Research
DAO Ecosystem
development

Each of these industries will demand new levels of
strategy development, thought leadership, constituent engagement, and new applications that
serve their specific needs. The Gitcoin network
has already run pilots in many of these industries,
including collaborations with the American Cancer
Society, DeSci projects, UNICEF, in Boulder Colorado, and more.

O N C H A I N C A P I TA L A L L O C AT I O N

18

The potential of capital allocation in each of these
industries feels underexplored yet transformative.
One way to reason about it is by analogy to how
email changed written communications. The average
human sends 100x more messages now than they
sent physical mail decades ago. We believe that the
future of capital allocation will entail 100x higher
volume and higher resolution funding decisions than
are available now.
The evolution of capital allocation has occured in a
skeuomorphic fashion over the last few decades:
physical cash was supplemented by physical checks,
which were supplemented by virtual checks (credit
cards). Credit cards and the internet introduced a
higher speed banking that enabled ecommerce and
crowdfunding platforms like Patreon, Kickstarter, or
Gitcoin Grants.

This essay originally appeared in the Gitcoin 2.0
whitepaper. It has been
edited and condensed
to fit this book). Read the
whole thing @

The next horizon is hard to see today, but by exploring it through this book & through the Gitcoin network we will discover it together. And because it is
built upon blockchains, we believe it will bring more
transparency and accountability to organizations
and more buying power to individuals through new
methods of collective ownership. We can reason
about what this frontier looks like by looking at the
properties of blockchains that it will be built upon. It
will be faster, more democratic, more emergent, and
more powerful than what has existed in the past.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY VITALIK BUTERIN,
GLEN WEYL, AND ZOE HITZEG

Quadratic Funding is a crowd-funding mechanism
that amplifies available resources by inviting community members to make donations (big or small) that
act as votes on where to allocate funds.
Quadratic Funding uses quadratic voting to aggregate individual preferences and democratically
allocate funding to public good. Matching funds are
distributed to recipients more based on the number
of contributors rather than the amount contributed,
ensuring that projects with a larger base get more
funding.
QF encourages wide participation and aligns funding
with the broader preferences of a community, so
it’s useful for allocating funding democratically and
for accurately revealing the preferences of a large
group.

Q U A D R AT I C F U N D I N G

32

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Quadratic Funding is particularly well-suited for communities that can provide a matching pool and have
members decide on the allocation of the matching
funds. This includes:

DAOs
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with large
treasuries: Quadratic Funding
can help DAOs allocate their
treasuries towards public
goods that benefit the broader
community, aligning incentives
and fostering a more participatory decision-making process.

Networks & Network
States
Networks and network states
that rely on community participation and collaboration can
benefit from Quadratic Funding
by incentivizing the development of public goods that improve the network’s infrastructure, security, or usability. By
allowing network participants
to vote on funding allocation,
blockchain networks can harness the collective wisdom of
their communities to support
projects that drive long-term
growth and adoption.

Large Protocols
Established blockchain protocols with substantial treasuries can leverage Quadratic
Funding to incentivize the
development of public goods
that benefit the protocol’s
ecosystem. By allowing token
holders to vote on project
funding, protocols can ensure
that resources are allocated
towards initiatives that contribute to the protocol’s growth
and success.

33

Q U A D R AT I C F U N D I N G

Quadratic Funding is particularly
valuable for groups that expect to run
multiple rounds over time and leverage the preferences revealed by their
community.
By iteratively funding public goods
projects based on community input,
these groups can continuously adapt
and refine their funding strategies,
ensuring that resources are allocated
towards initiatives that consistently
provide value to the community.

FUNDING
STRATEGY

Who is eligible
to receive funding
from the pool?

Public goods projects submit an application to be
included in a Quadratic Funding round. These applications are typically reviewed by program managers:
the group of people tasked with operating the round.
Eligibility should be determined by some preset
requirements. Projects that are accepted through
this application process are then eligible to receive
individual contributions from community members
and their share of the matching pool.

Q U A D R AT I C F U N D I N G

35

Who is eligible
to allocate?

Community members, usually represented by token
holders. These are the “voters” in this case, but they
vote by donating tokens to the projects they want
supported, in proportion to how much they want to
support that project.

How are payouts
calculated?

Payouts are calculated after the voting window has
closed and all the contributions are in.
The share of the matching pool that each project
gets is equal to the sum of the square roots of
their contribution amounts. As a rule of thumb, the
number of contributions a project received is used
to determine their share of the matching funds. This
is what makes QF so democratic: it’s the number of
community members who support a project that determines how much funding it will receive. Libraries
like Pluralistic.js or the Allo Starter kit can help in
doing these calculations.
Note that calculations are generally done off-chain
because the math required would otherwise incur a
high gas cost.

How is the pool
distributed?

After calculating the matching pool distribution in
the previous step, the managers of the QF round
then distribute the pool. In Allo Protocol (Gitcoin’s
capital allocation protocol), they upload this distribution to the strategy, then distribute it to the accepted
projects in one transaction.

Here’s the cool thing about Quadratic
Funding. This is the one weird trick that
makes QF into a funding powertool.
Each crowdfund contribution is matched. The match is
based more on the number of contributors than the $
amount given.
Quadratic Funding uses quadratic voting to determine how
funds are allocated. Instead of voice credits (as in quadratic
voting), donating to a public good is how you cast a vote;
the amount you donate is your voice or voting power.

As an example, let’s
say a community puts
forward $10,000 for
a matching fund and
three projects are
eligible to receive
funding.

Each project receives
their $10,000 from
the contributors in full
while the round is live.
After voting ends, we
can calculate and distribute the matching
pool.

Quadratic Funding stimulates engagement from a broader range of
donors living in these communities.
What’s neat about this is that it lets civic leaders
know which projects their constituents care about.
This map shows what goods people care about.
Each dot is a contributor or a project and each line
is a contribution. Using this data, we can give local
civic leaders a high resolution view of their constituent preferences, when before they mostly had low
resolution data.

In analogue democracies civic leaders know what
their constituents want every couple years through
elections. Quadratic Funding campaigns can be a
more frequent (and more high resolution - thousands of data points) signal for democratic leaders.
This data can then be used to create relationships
between civic leaders and the members of their
community doing the most good.

Retroactive Funding is a financial model that rewards
creators and developers of public goods—such
as open-source software, scientific research, and
community projects—after they have demonstrated a significant positive impact. Instead of funding
these projects upfront, funders assess the outcomes
and benefits generated and then provide grants or
financial rewards based on the achieved results.
This approach incentivizes high-quality work and
impactful projects by ensuring that resources are
allocated to initiatives that have proven their value
and effectiveness.

47

Who is eligible
to allocate?

Optimism RetroPGF Round 3, badgeholders were
eligible to allocate the funding. All badgeholders
have equal voting power. There were 208 badgeholders selected through various methods. This
included Round 2 bagdeholders, top 50 recipients
of RetroPGF 2, and 10 badges from the Optimism
Foundation. This diverse selection approach aimed
to ensure a broad representation of knowledgeable
individuals capable of fairly assessing and allocating
the funding.

How are payouts
calculated?

In Optimism RetroPGF Round 3, payouts were calculated using a median voting system. Badgeholders
could allocate up to 30 million OP tokens among
the projects, with each badgeholder able to allocate
between 0 and 30 million OP to a single project.
To qualify for payouts, a project needed to receive
17 votes or more. The results were then normalized
to ensure the total allocated amount matched the
round size of 30 million OP.

How is the pool
distributed?

In RetroPGF 3, following KYC completion with the
Optimism Foundation, projects received their rewards via a 90 day stream using Superfluid.
In EasyRetroPGF, the payout strategy is configurable. Funders may send different types of tokens on
any network, and may opt to use streaming protocols
like Superfluid or Hedgey to distribute the tokens.

TL;DR
DESIGNED BY DR. MICHAEL ZARGHAM,
POPULARIZED BY 1HIVE

Conviction Voting is a decision-making process
where participants allocate their voting power to
proposals over time, with the intensity of their support increasing the longer they back a proposal. This
system allows voters to express the strength of their
preferences and aims to balance minority and majority interests by emphasizing sustained commitment
over fleeting majority opinions.

CO NVI CTI O N VOTIN G

54

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Conviction Voting is ideal for decentralized organizations, cooperatives, and communities where
long-term commitment to decisions is valued. It is
particularly useful in environments where balancing
minority and majority interests is crucial and where
participants need a nuanced way to express the
strength of their preferences over time.

various projects and initiatives.
This system allows members
to continuously express
their support, with proposals
gaining more funding as they
accumulate sustained backing

FUNDING
STRATEGY
Who is eligible
to receive funding
from the pool?

In conviction voting systems like the one used by
1Hive, any member of the community can typically
propose initiatives to receive funding from the pool.
These proposals are then subject to the voting
process, where community members allocate their
voting power to support proposals. The eligibility
to propose and receive funding often depends on
the specific rules and governance structure of the
organization using conviction voting.

Who is eligible
to allocate?

In conviction voting systems any member of the
community who holds voting tokens or has voting
rights is eligible to allocate their votes to proposals.
The specific requirements for eligibility to vote, such
as holding a minimum amount of tokens or having
a certain level of participation, depend on the rules
set by the organization implementing the conviction
voting system.

How is Conviction Calculated?

In conviction voting systems, voting weight is typically calculated based on the accumulated “conviction” or voting weight that accrues by supporting
a proposal over time. Here are some of the setup
elements affecting this calculation:
1. Proposal Types: conviction voting systems can be
used simply to signal community sentiment, or linked
to funding pools where proposals can request tokens in discrete amounts or through token streams.
2. Conviction Growth: a parameter determining the

CO NVI CTI O N VOTIN G

57

rate that a voter’s conviction grows or shrinks over
time. Typically logarithmic and set as a half life.
3. Threshold: Funding proposals must surpass a
conviction threshold to qualify for funding. This
threshold often depends on the total funds available
and the relative support for other proposals.
4. Spending Limit and Minimum Conviction: additional parameters often used to limit the amount of
funds going to a single proposal, or require a quorum
of community support for proposals to pass.
5. Voting Weight System: separate from the time
weighted element of conviction, various strategies
can also be used to determine total weight, such
as 1 token = 1 vote, quadratic voting, or equal voting
power for all.
The exact formulas and mechanisms can vary, but
the core idea is that sustained and strong support
increases the likelihood and amount of funding a
proposal receives.

How is the pool
distributed?

By nature, conviction voting systems are continuous,
allowing proposals to be created and considered
over time rather than in epochs or seasonal funding
events.
In this way, conviction voting sacrifices the ability
to make decisions quickly and resolutely, favoring
a more truthful representation of community sentiment uncovered over time. Pool distributions can
then happen either continuously or approved oneby-one as thresholds are met.
In Allo, the funds can be distributed to the accepted
projects in one transaction, or via stream protocols
like Superfluid or drips.

CO NVI CTI O N VOTIN G

58

HOW DOES
IT WORK?

1. Setup
A DAO sets up a treasury of
tokens allocated to Conviction
Voting
Usually this is a DAO that
wants to incentivize and grow
its own ecosystem.

2. Proposal Submission
Community members submit
proposals for funding.

3. Continuous Voting
Members allocate their voting
power to proposals they support, with conviction growing
over time as votes remain
allocated.

4. Threshold and
Distribution
Once proposals reach the
required conviction threshold,
they receive funding from the
pool, with funds distributed
proportionally based on the
accumulated conviction.

CO NVI CTI O N VOTIN G

59

HOW DOES
CONVICTION GROW
OVER TIME?
Typically, a mathematical formula, such as a weighted average or a decaying logarithmic function, is
used to calculate the conviction, ensuring that
sustained support leads to higher conviction levels.
Conviction Voting emphasizes long-term commitment and sustained support for proposals rather
than short-term, transient voting.

POPULARIZED BY PROTOCOL GUILD

Self-Curated Registries were popularized by Protocol
Guild - a group of Ethereum protocol developers. The
guild is a self curated registry, an onchain list maintained by the members of Protocol Guild themselves.
This registry allows members to add, update, or
remove entries without external oversight, ensuring
that the information remains accurate and relevant to
the community’s needs. It empowers participants by
giving them control over the registry’s content, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility - and
enabling projects built upon Ethereum to directly
contribute to Ethereum developers upon which they
depend.

S E L F - C U R AT E D R E G I S T R I E S

66

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
A self-curated registry should be used by communities with clear boundaries. This is particularly beneficial for groups focused on domains where there is no
shared funding source, such as Ethereum protocol
developers.
By allowing members to directly curate the registry, self-curated registries ensure the information
remains accurate, relevant, and reflective of the
community’s evolving needs and contributions. This
makes it easy for parties to fund their shared needs
by just sending tokens to the self curated registry.

WHO USES IT?
Protocol Guild V1
Protocol Guild ran a one year pilot from May ‘22 - May ‘23 to test
their assumptions about the Protocol Guild’s funding mechanism
and how to operate it. As of July 2024, Protocol Guild has received 7.9k donations from 600 donors, totalling $88mm in value
at the time of donation The top donors include Ether Fi ($30m),
Taiko ($24m), Layer Zero ($5m) and Arbitrum($2.4m).

S E L F - C U R AT E D R E G I S T R I E S

67

THE PROTOCOL
GUILD PILOT
Protocol Guild was initially conceived as a way to
“boost the incentives around stewarding the core
protocol.” In retrospect, this goal was perhaps not
ambitious enough. A significant portion of core
protocol development is currently being funded by
centralized—and potentially unsustainable—sources,
including the Ethereum Foundation (EF), ConsenSys,
and a few others. To secure the future of Ethereum’s
core development work, the goal was to create a
new equilibrium in core protocol funding, sustained
by the ecosystem built on top of it.

PROTOCOL GUILD’S GOALS:
To serve as a counterbalance
to EF/corporate-funded core
protocol development, or at
worst, a funder of last resort.

To enable a one-stop-shop for
funding the entire core protocol (research, implementation,
coordination, testing).

To incentivize new contributors
to join core protocol development.

To help retain existing core
protocol developers over the
long term.

To normalize setting aside a
portion of ecosystem revenues
to fund core protocol development.

Achieving the above in a sustainable and decentralized way will be a years-long process, and require
buy-in from across the Ethereum ecosystem.
Fortunately, it’s the exact kind of challenge that our
community is uniquely suited to rally around!

FUNDING
STRATEGY

Who is eligible
to receive funding

In Protocol Guild, the registry is maintained through
a self-curation process by its members, who are
typically key contributors to the protocol. Members
coordinate to add, update, or remove entries on a
quarterly basis, ensuring that the registry remains
accurate over time.

Who is eligible
to allocate?

Protocol Guild’s eligibility framework includes individuals who have made significant contributions to
the protocol, such as developers, researchers, and
other essential contributors. This ensures that the
registry is curated by those with the most knowledge and investment in the protocol’s success.

S E L F - C U R AT E D R E G I S T R I E S

How are payouts

69

Protocol Guild is funded by projects built on Ethereum, who have a dependency on the continued
development and maintenance of the protocol.
Projects are encouraged to donate their native token
to the Protocol Guild, to give its members access to
a diversified basket of funds representing the value
being created in the ecosystem.
Funds are managed via smart contracts, which ensure transparency and automate the disbursement
process. Members receive their allocated funds
according to a linear 4 year vesting schedule.
Each members’ individual allocation is proportional
to the number of months they have been contributing to eligible projects.
Vesting and time-weighting ensure that the distribution is fair, efficient, and aligned with the long-term
goals of the protocol.

Protocol Guild has several distinctive
attributes that set it apart from other
onchain mechanisms:
Focus on Protocol
Development

Funding from Ecosystem
Stakeholders

The guild is designed to
support and incentivize key
contributors to the protocol,
such as developers, researchers, and other critical roles,
fostering an ecosystem of
continuous improvement and
innovation.

The guild is typically funded
by stakeholders within the
ecosystem who have a vested
interest in the protocol’s
success, such as apps, L2s or
DAOs built on Ethereum,, as
well as philanthropic entities
focused on funding public
goods.

Contributor-Centric
Vesting

Self-Curated Registry

Tokens or rewards are vested
to contributors over time,
aligning their incentives with
the long-term success of the
protocol and encouraging
sustained contributions.

Members of Protocol Guild
maintain and update the registry autonomously, ensuring
that the most knowledgeable
contributors manage the relevant information.

Decentralized
Governance
Decisions about the registry
and other guild activities
are made collectively by the
members, often through proposals and voting, ensuring a
decentralized and democratic
governance structure.

Differences from other onchain
mechanisms (cont’d):
Member-Driven Curation

Long-Term Incentives

Unlike many other onchain
mechanisms that might rely on
external parties or automated
systems for updates, Protocol
Guild relies on its members
for maintaining the registry,
ensuring that the information is
curated by those most involved
in the protocol.

The vesting schedule for
rewards in Protocol Guild is
designed to promote long-term
engagement, whereas other
mechanisms might provide
immediate or short-term
incentives.

Direct Community
Funding

Targeted Support for
Key Contributors

Protocol Guild only works
when ecosystem stakeholders
opt-in to fund the mechanism,
as opposed to mechanisms
that might rely on transaction
fees or other indirect funding
sources.

The guild aims to support individuals who play critical roles
in the protocol’s development,
whereas other mechanisms
might distribute rewards more
broadly or based on different
criteria

Wen Protocol Guild forks?
“The ecosystem needs to more fully recognize
that cross-L2 infrastructure is a type of Ethereum

TL;DR
POPULARIZED BY QUESTBOOK

Dedicated Domain Allocation, as popularized by
Questbook, refers to the practice of assigning
specific funding streams or resources to particular
domains or areas within a project or organization.
This method ensures that resources are consistently directed towards designated areas, facilitating better management and tracking of funds. By
clearly delineating which resources are allocated to
which domains, DDA aims to enhance transparency,
accountability, and efficiency in the management of
project resources and funding.

D E L E G AT E D D O M A I N A L L O C AT I O N

76

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Dedicated Domain Allocation is best suited for organizations that require precise control and accountability over the allocation of resources to different
areas or projects. This approach is particularly
beneficial for large enterprises, government agencies, and non-profit organizations managing complex
operations with diverse funding streams and distinct
project domains. By implementing Dedicated Domain
Allocation, these organizations can enhance transparency, streamline resource management, and
ensure that funds are directed towards priority areas
in alignment with their strategic objectives.

power the Compound Grants Fund of $800K USD (22k COMP),
spread across two quarters, to find and fund a wide variety of
teams building on Compound.
They’ve also used it to run an Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across two quarters to fund a wide variety of
teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner.
Each of these programs have budget that is managed by four individuals called domain allocators - chosen from the community and
by the community. These domain allocators manage grants for a
domain. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which the
customer wants to disburse grants.teams building apps on top of
Arbitrum in a transparent manner.

Eligibility often hinges on demonstrating how the
proposed activities will contribute to the advancement of domain-specific objectives, address identified needs or challenges, and align with the overarching mission of the organization or project.

Who is eligible
to allocate?

Eligibility to allocate funding is often based on
factors such as expertise in the domain, knowledge
of project priorities, and accountability for ensuring
effective resource utilization.
These individuals are entrusted with making informed decisions about how to distribute resources
within the allocated domain, aligning allocations with
strategic objectives, and maximizing the impact of
the funding to achieve desired outcomes.

How are payouts
calculated?

79

In Dedicated Domain Allocation, payouts are typically calculated based on predetermined criteria and
guidelines established for each domain.
Each domain can use a different capital allocation
strategy. Typically, decision-makers responsible for
allocating funds assess funding requests submitted
by eligible entities within the domain, taking into
account the alignment of proposed projects with
domain objectives, available resources, and overall
strategic priorities.
Payouts are then determined through a systematic
evaluation process that aims to ensure equitable
distribution of resources while maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of funding allocation within
the designated domain.

How is the pool
distributed?

The pool may be distributed at the end of each DDA
rouind, via a normal ERC20 txn on an L2.
In Allo DDA build (coming soon), the funds can be
distributed it to the accepted projects in one transaction, or via stream protocols like Superfluid
or drips.

START AT THE
BEGINNING
When contemplating a dedicated domain allocation
round, it’s crucial to begin by clearly defining the domains and their objectives, ensuring they align with
the organization’s overarching goals. Understanding
the specific needs and priorities within each domain
will inform resource allocation decisions and facilitate targeted investments.
Next, establish transparent and legible processes
for soliciting and evaluating funding requests. This
involves developing clear guidelines for proposal
submission, outlining evaluation criteria, and establishing decision-making mechanisms that involve
stakeholders from relevant domains. By fostering inclusivity and accountability in the allocation process,
organizations can ensure that resources are distributed effectively and in accordance with domain-specific objectives.
Finally, prioritize communication and collaboration
throughout the allocation round to foster engagement and buy-in from stakeholders. Regularly communicate updates on the allocation process, solicit
feedback from stakeholders, and provide opportunities for input to enhance transparency and trust. By
actively involving stakeholders in the decision-making process and maintaining open lines of communication, organizations can maximize the success of
their dedicated domain allocation round and drive
meaningful impact within targeted areas.

83

TL;DR
POPULARIZED BY CHARLES EISENSTEIN
& COORDINAPE

A gift circle, as popularized on Coordinape, is a
decentralized, community-driven process where
members of a team or organization allocate virtual
tokens, known as GIVE, to recognize and reward
each other’s contributions. Participants receive a
set amount of GIVE tokens to distribute among their
peers based on perceived value and impact. This
method fosters collaboration and appreciation within
the community, ensuring that rewards are aligned
with collective insights and efforts.

GIFT CIRCLES

84

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Gift Circles are best suited for decentralized organizations, collaborative teams, and communities that
value peer recognition and collective decision-making.
They are particularly effective in environments
where contributions are diverse and not easily quantified by traditional metrics. Teams in open-source
projects, DAOs, and cooperative groups can benefit
from gift circles to foster a sense of appreciation,
enhance engagement, and align rewards with community values.

WHO USES IT?
Coordinape ecosystem
Coordinape is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate
peer-to-peer recognition and reward distribution within communities, particularly in DAOs. It leverages a system where members
allocate virtual tokens, known as GIVE, to each other based on
perceived contributions and value added. This process, known as
a gift circle, promotes a more bottoms-up and transparent method
of acknowledging efforts and distributing rewards, reflecting the
collective insights and values of the community.
By utilizing Coordinape, organizations can enhance collaboration
and engagement, ensuring that rewards are aligned with the
actual contributions recognized by peers rather than top-down
management. The platform’s decentralized nature helps fosters a
sense of community and mutual appreciation, making it particularly suited for collaborative environments and projects where
traditional hierarchical reward systems might fall short.

FUNDING
STRATEGY

Who is eligible
to receive funding
from the pool?

In gift circles, all participating members of the community or organization are eligible to receive funding
from the pool. Each member is typically allocated a
set amount of virtual tokens, which they can distribute to their peers based on perceived contributions
and value. This ensures that anyone who actively
contributes to the community has the opportunity to
be recognized and rewarded by their peers.

Who is eligible
to allocate?

In gift circles, all participating members of the
community or organization are eligible to allocate
virtual tokens. Each member is given a set amount
of tokens, which they can distribute to their peers
based on their perceived contributions and impact.
This peer-to-peer allocation process ensures that
recognition and rewards are distributed according
to the collective judgment of the community rather
than a centralized authority.

GIFT CIRCLES

87

How are payouts
calculated?

In gift circles, payouts are calculated based on the
virtual tokens allocated by participants to their
peers. Each member distributes a set amount of
tokens to others based on their perceived contributions. The total amount of tokens received by each
participant determines their share of the funding
pool. The more tokens a member receives from their
peers, the larger their payout from the pool, ensuring
that rewards are proportional to the community’s
recognition of their efforts.

How is the pool
distributed?

Typically, DAOs use their own tokens to reward
contributors to a gift circle. These tokens can be sent
out in an ERC20 transfer.
In Allo Gift Circles (coming soon), the funds can
be distributed it to the accepted projects in one
transaction, or via stream protocols like Superfluid or
drips.

Grant Ships is an “evolutionary grants game” where
subDAOs (Grant Ships) compete to effectively
distribute funds within any ecosystem. The process
begins with electing and funding Grant Ships and
a game facilitator team. Each round, Grant Ships
receive capital, evaluate applications, and distribute
funds. They report their activities, which the ecosystem community then ranks through a weighted
token vote. Successful Grant Ships get more funding
in subsequent rounds, while underperforming ones
may be replaced. This system emphasizes pluralism,
accountability, and adaptive improvement.

INVENTED BY GORDON TULLOCK

An Assurance Contract is where people agree to
contribute money to a project, but only if enough
others also commit to funding it. If the project
meets its funding goal, everyone pays their pledged
amount, and the project goes ahead. If the goal isn’t
met, the project is canceled, and no one has to pay.
This way, contributors are assured that their money
will only be used if there are sufficient funds to complete the project.

INVENTED BY ALEX TABBARROK

A Dominant Assurance Contract is a variant of
an assurance contract with additional incentives.
People pledge money with the promise that if the
project doesn’t get enough funds to proceed, they
will get their money back, plus a bonus. This bonus
comes from the project organizer and serves as an
extra incentive to encourage people to contribute,
making it a smart choice to pledge money regardless
of what others do.

(D O MINANT) ASSURAN CE CO NTRACTS

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Assurance Contracts and Dominant Assurance
Contracts should be used by project organizers
and fundraisers who are seeking to overcome the
free-rider problem and ensure sufficient participation
in funding public goods or collective projects. They
are particularly useful for crowdfunding campaigns,
community initiatives, and other collective endeavors where reaching a funding threshold is critical for
project viability. By offering a financial incentive to
contributors if the funding goal isn’t met, organizers
can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving
the required funding.

WHO USES IT?
Public Radio and
Television
Assurance Contracts are often
used in fundraising campaigns
for public radio and television.
Stations pledge to provide
programming if they reach a
certain funding threshold.

Kickstarter
Kickstarter operates similarly
to an assurance contract. On
Kickstarter, project creators set
a funding goal and a deadline. People pledge money to
support the project, but their
contributions are only collected if the total pledges meet or
exceed the funding goal by the
deadline. If the goal is not met,
no money is collected, and
backers are not charged.

Environmental
Campaigns
In 1999, the Save the
Redwoods League used an
assurance contract to secure
the purchase of the Headwaters Forest in California. The
campaign required raising a
significant amount of money
from donors, which was only
collected once the target
amount was reached.

FUNDING
STRATEGY

Who is eligible
to receive funding
from the pool?

In a Dominant Assurance Contract, the project
proposer(s) are eligible to receive funding from the
pool if the contract’s conditions, such as reaching a
sufficient number of pledged contributions, are met.
If these conditions are not met, the contributors are
refunded their money, and they may also receive an
assurance premium as an incentive for their initial
pledge.

Who is eligible
to allocate?

In a Dominant Assurance Contract, the eligibility
to allocate typically lies with the contributors who
pledge funds to the project. These contributors
decide whether to pledge their money, effectively
allocating funds toward the project if the funding
goal is reached. If enough pledges are made to meet
the contract’s conditions, the project receives the
funding; otherwise, the funds are refunded to the
contributors, along with any assurance premium.

(D O MINANT) ASSURAN CE CO NTRACTS

105

How are payouts
calculated?

In dominant assurance contracts, payouts are calculated based on whether the funding goal is met.
If the required amount of contributions is pledged,
the project proposer receives the pledged funds
to carry out the project. If the goal is not met, the
pledged funds are returned to the contributors, often
with an additional assurance premium paid to them
as an incentive for their participation. The premium
compensates contributors for the risk they took in
pledging to a potentially unfunded project.

How is the pool
distributed?

In dominant assurance contracts, the pool is distributed based on the project’s funding outcome. If the
funding goal is met, the entire pool of pledged contributions is given to the project proposer to carry out
the project. If the funding goal is not met, the pool is
returned to the contributors, with each contributor
receiving their pledged amount plus an assurance
premium. This premium serves as an incentive for
their participation, compensating them for the risk
they took in pledging to the project.
The funds can be sent as an ETH or ERC20 txn. In
Allo, the funds can be distributed it to the accepted
projects in one transaction, or via stream protocols
like Superfluid or drips.

(D O MINANT) ASSURAN CE CO NTRACTS

106

THE GAME
THEORY
A Dominant Assurance Contract is a mechanism in
game theory designed to overcome the free-rider
problem often encountered in the provision of public
goods. In a traditional assurance contract, individuals pledge to contribute to a project only if enough
others do the same, ensuring that the project will
only proceed if it is sufficiently funded. However, this
can still lead to suboptimal outcomes if individuals
choose to wait for others to contribute first, hoping
to free-ride on others’ contributions.
To address this, the Dominant Assurance Contract
introduces an additional incentive structure. The
organizer promises to compensate contributors if
the project fails to reach its funding goal, typically by
offering a bonus or refund that exceeds their initial
contribution. This turns the decision to contribute
into a dominant strategy, meaning that contributing
is the best option regardless of what others do. Even
if the project does not go ahead, contributors are
better off than if they had not contributed, due to the
compensation offered.
By aligning individual incentives with the collective
goal, dominant assurance contracts ensure higher
participation rates. Participants are motivated to
contribute because they are guaranteed to benefit
either from the successful completion of the project
or from the compensation if the project fails. This
mechanism effectively solves the coordination problem and leads to the successful provision of public
goods that might otherwise be underfunded.

A social graph is a digital representation of the relationships and interactions between individuals within a
social network. It maps out the connections between people, such as
friendships, family ties, professional
relationships, and other social interactions.
This graph helps social media platforms and other
online services understand user behavior, suggest
connections, and provide personalized content.
Essentially, it visualizes how users are linked to each
other, enabling better insights into social dynamics
and network structures.

SOCIAL TRUST
--> VALUE
CREATION
Using Social Graphs, anyone can build advanced
capital allocation networks that significantly enhance
funding processes and investment efficiency. One
possible example is a decentralized venture network
that leverages social graphs to map relationships
between entrepreneurs, startups, and investors.
This network could facilitate precise matchmaking,
ensuring that capital is directed to startups with the
highest potential based on trust and previous successes within the network. It would streamline the
investment process by enabling investors to identify
promising ventures through trusted connections and
shared interests.
Another innovative application is peer-to-peer
lending platforms that utilize social graphs to create
trust-based lending networks. These platforms would
allow individuals to lend money to peers within their
social network or extended community, reducing default risks and fostering a sense of community-based
financial support. Additionally, social graphs can enhance crowdfunding efforts by identifying potential
backers within a project’s social network, increasing
engagement and funding success rates.
In summary, these networks leverage the power
of social connections and trust to optimize capital
distribution, improve funding outcomes, and promote
collaborative financial ecosystems.

THE GAME
THEORY
The Strategic Interaction of
Stakeholders
In a game theoretic context, Impact Attestations can
be seen as a strategic tool used by various stakeholders to align incentives and ensure cooperation.
For funders, such as governments, non-profits, and
philanthropic organizations, the attestation acts as a
verification mechanism to ensure that their resources are being used effectively. By providing transparent, evidence-based reports on the outcomes
of funded projects, Impact Attestations encourage
recipients to align their actions with the desired
outcomes. This creates a scenario where both
parties benefit: funders achieve their social or policy
objectives, and recipients gain continued support
and credibility.

Signaling and Credibility
Impact Attestations also function as a signaling
mechanism. Organizations that can provide credible
attestations signal to potential funders and stakeholders their capability and effectiveness. This helps
in differentiating them from less effective organizations, thereby attracting more funding and support.
For funders, requiring impact attestations from
grantees reduces the information asymmetry, as it
provides a reliable means to assess the true impact

I M PA C T AT T E S TAT I O N S

122

of their investments. This signaling leads to a more
efficient allocation of resources, as funders can identify and support the most effective initiatives.

Risk Management and Assurance
Funders face the risk of their resources being
misallocated or not achieving the desired impact.
By requiring Impact Attestations, funders shift
some of this risk onto the recipients, who must then
prove the efficacy of their projects. This creates an
environment where recipients are incentivized to
design and implement high-quality interventions
that can withstand rigorous evaluation. Additionally,
Impact Attestations serve as a form of assurance
for funders, providing them with the confidence that
their investments are yielding the intended social
benefits. This assurance can encourage further
investment and long-term partnerships, fostering
a sustainable ecosystem of funding and impactful
social initiatives.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY THOMAS PAINE

Universal Basic Income is a social welfare program
where all citizens receive a regular, unconditional
sum of money from the government, regardless of
their income, employment status, or wealth. The
primary goal is to reduce poverty and inequality,
provide financial security, and support economic
stability by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs
are met.

UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME

126

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Universal Basic Income should be considered by
policymakers seeking to address economic inequality, reduce poverty, and provide a safety net for all
citizens, especially in economies facing job automation, unemployment, or underemployment. It can also
benefit individuals in precarious employment situations, ensuring everyone has a basic level of financial
security regardless of their work status.

THE GAME
THEORY
In game theory, UBI can be viewed as a mechanism
to shift the Nash equilibrium in a society. Without
UBI, individuals might compete intensely for limited
resources, often leading to suboptimal outcomes
like poverty and inequality. UBI aims to change this
dynamic by ensuring a basic level of resources for
everyone, potentially leading to more cooperative
behaviors and reducing the competition for survival.
In a UBI, the assurance of a basic income reduces
the desperation that drives individuals to accept
poor working conditions or exploitative wages. This
could result in a new equilibrium where employers
must offer better wages and working conditions to
attract and retain employees, as workers are not
forced to take any job out of necessity. This change
can lead to a more balanced labor market, where
power is more evenly distributed between employers
and employees.
UBI can impact social cooperation and trust. In
game theory, trust and cooperation are crucial for
achieving optimal outcomes in repeated interactions.
By providing a financial safety net, UBI may reduce
the economic stress that often drives short-term,
self-interested behaviors, encouraging long-term
cooperative strategies instead. As individuals feel
more secure, they might be more willing to invest
in education, entrepreneurship, and community
engagement, fostering a more inclusive and resilient
economy.

THE GAME
THEORY
Game Theory and Community
Currencies: Incentives and
Cooperation
The success of a community currency hinges on the
cooperation and participation of local businesses
and consumers. From a game-theoretic perspective,
individuals are incentivized to use the currency if
they believe others will also participate. This creates
a positive feedback loop where increased usage by
some members encourages others to join, enhancing
the overall utility and acceptance of the currency.
The key to initiating this loop is ensuring enough
initial buy-in and trust in the system’s value, akin to
achieving a critical mass in a coordination game.

Trust and Reciprocity in Community
Currency Systems
Trust and reciprocity are fundamental components in
the game theory of Community Currencies. Participants must trust that the currency will be widely
accepted and retain its value over time. This trust
can be modeled as a repeated game, where ongoing
interactions between participants foster mutual trust
and cooperation. In such a setting, businesses and
consumers engage in reciprocal behavior: businesses accept the currency, expecting customers to use
it, and vice versa. Successful community currencies

CO MMUNITY CURREN CIES

136

often employ strategies to build and maintain this
trust, such as transparent governance, community
involvement in decision-making, and backing the
currency with tangible assets or services.

Overcoming Free-Rider Problems and
Ensuring Stability
Community Currencies face potential free-rider
problems, where some individuals might benefit from
the system without actively participating or contributing. Establishing clear rules and ensuring consistent enforcement can help maintain the currency’s
integrity and stability, creating a sustainable system
where all participants benefit from mutual cooperation and contribution.

139

TL;DR
POPULARIZED BY ROBIN HANSON

Futarchy is a form of governance where policies are
chosen based on prediction markets. In a futarchy,
elected representatives define and measure the
metrics that reflect the well-being of the population.
Then, prediction markets are used to forecast the
impact of proposed policies on these metrics. The
policies predicted to have the best outcomes are implemented. This system aims to combine democratic
values with the informational efficiency of markets to
make better-informed decisions.

F U TA R C H Y

140

WHO SHOULD
USE IT?
Futarchy is best suited for organizations, governments, or communities seeking to make evidence-based decisions using the predictive power
of markets. It is particularly useful in contexts where
there is significant uncertainty about the outcomes
of various policies and where stakeholders value
empirical, data-driven approaches to governance.
Futarchy can be effective for entities that prioritize
optimizing for well-defined metrics of well-being
and are open to innovative governance models that
leverage collective intelligence.

PREDICT THIS
Predictive Power
Futarchy relies on prediction
markets, which have been
shown to outperform traditional forecasting methods by
aggregating diverse information from multiple participants
with financial incentives to be
accurate.

Founding Story
The concept was proposed
by economist Robin Hanson
in 2000, aiming to combine
democratic values with the efficiency of market mechanisms
to improve policy decisions.

Outcome-based
governance
Unlike traditional governance,
which often relies on elected
officials’ judgment, Futarchy
bases decisions on measurable
outcomes of well-being, determined and agreed upon by the
electorate.

F U TA R C H Y

141

THE GAME
THEORY
Futarchy leverages the principles of game theory to
enhance decision-making processes by aligning incentives with accurate predictions. At its core, Futarchy relies on prediction markets, where participants
buy and sell shares based on their expectations of
future outcomes. These markets harness the collective wisdom of participants, who have a financial
stake in predicting correctly, thus incentivizing them
to utilize all available information and expertise. This
setup ensures that the market prices reflect a consensus forecast, which theoretically represents the
best possible prediction of future events, reducing
the likelihood of biases or uninformed decisions.
In Futarchy, the interplay of incentives is crucial. Participants are motivated to provide truthful information because their financial gains or losses depend
on the accuracy of their predictions. This creates
a self-correcting mechanism where misinformation
or poor predictions are penalized, and accurate,
informed predictions are rewarded. The competitive
nature of prediction markets, a fundamental aspect
of game theory, ensures continuous improvement
of the information available to decision-makers. As
more participants engage in the market, the aggregate knowledge increases, leading to more reliable
and precise forecasts.
Futarchy addresses common issues in traditional
governance, such as information asymmetry and the
principal-agent problem. In traditional systems,

F U TA R C H Y

142

decision-makers might not have access to all relevant information or may act in their self-interest
rather than the public good. In contrast, Futarchy
decentralizes the decision-making process, distributing it across a diverse group of market participants.
This diffusion of power and reliance on market-driven
predictions helps mitigate the risks associated with
centralized decision-making and the potential for
corruption or misalignment of interests. By using
game theory to structure these markets, Futarchy
aims to create a more efficient, transparent, and
accountable governance system.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central
authority, using blockchain technology to secure
transactions.
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables
the creation and execution of smart contracts and
decentralized applications (dApps) using blockchain
technology.
Hivemapper is a decentralized mapping platform that
uses dashcam footage from contributors to build and
maintain up-to-date maps.
Helium is a decentralized wireless network that uses
blockchain technology to incentivize the creation
and maintenance of a global network of hotspots for
IoT devices.
What do each of these have in common? They are
networks of volunteers who run hardware that ensures the operation of the network. In exchange for
running the hardware, node operators are rewarded
with cryptocurrency.

TL;DR

Bounties are incentives or rewards offered for
completing specific tasks or challenges, often used
in open-source projects, cybersecurity, and community-driven initiatives to motivate individuals to
contribute skills, solve problems, or find vulnerabilities. These rewards can be monetary or in the form
of recognition and aim to harness collective effort for
achieving particular goals.
Bounties can be organized into Hackathons, where
participants work intensively over a short period
to solve challenges or complete tasks for rewards.
Hackathons provide a collaborative environment
that encourages innovation and rapid problem-solving, attracting diverse talent to tackle the bounties,
which can lead to creative solutions and accelerated
project development.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY WILLIAM ROBERT WARE

Ranked Choice Voting is an electoral system where
voters rank candidates or proposals in order of
preference. If no candidate wins a majority of firstchoice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes
is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to
the remaining candidates based on the voters’ next
preferences. This process continues until one candidate has a majority, promoting broader support and
reducing the likelihood of strategic voting.

There will be more funding

HOW DO WE
CLASSIFY THESE
MECHANISMS?
Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and
classifying organisms.
How might we arrive at a way of classifying the
mechanisms we’ve discussed in this book? In this
chapter, I will try to cut through the “fog of war” of
the design space and sketch out a path to a taxonomy of mechanisms.

THE DESIGN SPACE
By reflecting on the growth of the internet empirically, and by reasoning about the a priori parallels
between web1 and web2, we can reason about how
web3 might play out…
The internet of
information

Just as email, IMs, Twitter and Tik Tok, and LLMs
changed how we transfer information, the internet of
money could change how we transfer money. How
we Fund What Matters.
We have Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing
Games (MMORPGs). Now that we’ve got web3,
will we have Massively Multiplayer Online Funding
Games (MMOFPs)? Can large networks of people
coordinating resources be more powerful than large
corporations/governments/billionaires?
I have an instinct that peer-to-peer funding games
may be the biggest wedge we have to create 21st
century collective action. There is a greenfield
opportunity to explore the design space around
Gitcoin’s mission, to “Fund What Matters.”

FUNDING WHAT MATTERS
Gitcoin’s mission, “Fund What Matters,” is a directive emphasizing the importance of investing in or
financially supporting causes, projects, or initiatives
that hold significant value or impact. It suggests
prioritizing spending in areas that make a meaningful
difference, whether socially, environmentally, culturally, or economically.
This phrase often encourages individuals or organizations to think critically about where their money
can have the greatest positive effect. It’s a call to
action for responsible and purpose-driven allocation
of resources, aligning financial decisions with core
values and priorities.

M E C H A N I S M TA X O N O M Y

189

THE MISSION
X THE DESIGN SPACE
By leveraging blockchain technology, the attributes
of it that make it powerful (transparency, corruption
resistance, global, open source, programmable), and
the wave of innovation surrounding the EVM, we
can help evolve how people “Fund What Matters” to
them.
Just as the internet accelerated the flow of information, web3 can accelerate the flow of capital. We
can ride this wave to build and scale new funding
experiments.

THE PAST
In 2019, the bear market had just hit, and projects
in the Ethereum ecosystem needed funding. At the
time, the major forces in Eth public goods funding
were the Ethereum Community Fund, the Ethereum
Foundation, and Consensys. The EF/ECF had grants
programs or you could get hired at Consensys.
Gitcoin discovered Quadratic Funding in late 2018
and launched Gitcoin Grants in January 2019. We
were differentiated from the existing players by the
decentralized decision making introduced by Quadratic Funding.
I think the design space kind of looked like this:
1. Technocratic = small group of decision makers.
At the ECF/EF back then, you had to go through a
grantmaking process where a small commitee would

M E C H A N I S M TA X O N O M Y

190

got funding. At Consensys, you had to be hired by
Joe Lubin or his disciples.
2. Democratic = larger more permissionless group of
decision makers. At Gitcoin, anyone can help allocate
the funding due to Quadratic Funding. This scales
because 1000s of projects can get funded at once.

Of course, this doesn’t tell the full story. If you were
to add a 2nd axis showing the amount of funding
being deployed, the design space would look something like this:

THE PRESENT
Over the course of 2022, more players entered the
space and we began to see the rise of retroactive
public goods funding experiments like Optimism
RetroPGF and very simple but effective mechanisms
like the Protocol Guild’s self-curating registry.

Optimism & Protocol Guild evolved
the design space forward in important ways
1. Retroactive Public Goods Funding is based off the
idea that it is easier to fund projects based on the
impact they’ve already had. As opposed to speculating on the impact they might have in the future.
After RetroPGF is established, we can then bet that
projects could receive proactive funding based on
future retroactive rewards.
2. Protocol Guild built a very simple mechanism, a
self-curating registry. This registry allowed projects
to easily contribute to protocol development.

LET’S GET WEIRD
Lets look at what this new design space looks like all
together. If we combine the two 3D cubes, we get a

Since us humans have evolved to understand 3D
images, this 4D visualization is a bit hard to grok
visually. That said, once you spend some time staring
at it, you will can internalize that we’ve found a way
to conceptualize the entire design space across all 4
dimensions:
1. Technocratic vs democratic
2. Amount of funding
3. Proactive vs retroactive
4. Simple vs complex
This is where things get interesting to me. As people
begin launching projects that are empirically effective at funding what matters to them (maybe using
the mechanisms in this book), we can start to build
up a multi-dimensional space of what the design
space looks like.

Now we are really starting to cartography the design
space. By creating visualizations of how these
mechanisms relate to each other, and extracting the
criteria that makes them different, we’re starting to
get a visual of the design space! We’ve started to
beat back the fog of war of the possibilities.

M E C H A N I S M TA X O N O M Y

195

What dimensions would we even care to splice the
design space by? And would each dimension justify
the complexity of thinking in higher dimensional
thinking? Since it’s hard to think in higher than 3
dimensions, maybe we’d be better off focusing on
design spaces 3 dimensions or less.
That said, there might be value in exploring what
dimensions to even look at. We can make some
educated guesses here. Here are all of the additional dimensions I think would ever matter within the
design space of “how do you build a mechanism that
helps people fund what matters?”

1. Mature projects vs seed projects - Is the mechanism more for
mature projects or seed stage projects?
2. Age of the mechanism - Was it invented in pre-history, during
the industrial era, early internet, or the onchain internet era?
3. Web2 vs web3 UX - Is the UX usable for web2 natives?
4. Effective or not - Is the mechanism actually effective at whatever its goal is (in Gitcoin’s case, funding what matters)? How big
is the TAM?
5. Return expected vs not - Is a return expected as part of the
fundraise? Or not?
6. Virality vs no is virality - a big part of the mechanism? Like for
Quadratic Funding, where people tend to share their grants on
social media.
7. Does it depend on Impact Attestations? Does the mechanism
depend on impact attestations? Do we have a reliable proof-ofimpact?
8. Oracle-limited or not? If the mechanism depends on some
external data source, is it limited by having reliable oracles or not?
Eg if you were trying to fund a project to stop deforestation, what
is the data-trail between the forest and the blockchain?
9. Credibly neutral vs not - Does the mechanism’s constituents
care that its credibly neutral, or does it allow for rent-seeking
intermediaries?
10. Desktop vs mobile - Is the mechanism experience desktop first
(okcupid, match.com), or mobile-first? (like Tinder)
11. Built into social media? Is the mechanism a standalone website,

M E C H A N I S M TA X O N O M Y

196

or built onto a web3 social network like Farcaster/Lens Protocol?
12. Massively multiplayer? Will the mechanism work at scale?
Will it enable Massively Multiplayer Online Funding Games
(MMOFPs)?
13. Are assets fungible or not? Do the primary assets in the mechanism resemble fungible things like ERC-20s? Or are they more
based on ERC-721 like assets?
14. Are they stateful or stateless? Ephemeral like a QF round or
persistent like Protocol Guild?
15. Can it be built on top of Allo? This is a germane question for
Gitcoin. Does Allo help make it easier to bring to market?
16. Can it be built on top of Passport? Does the mechanism benefit from sybil resistance? If so, does Passport newly enable it?
17. Where does the coordination breakthrough happen? Through
novel onchain primitives, shared identity/high trust communities,
novel game theory?
18. Single mechanism or multi-mechanism. These mechanism are
composable after all..
19. Is the funding continuous/recurring? Is it based off dependably
economically exothermic funding sources? Does the mechanism
depend on fickle things like people donating? Or does it depend
on continuous sources of funding (like sequencer fees or yield)?
20. There are probably more ....

Which combinations of these criteria have billion$$$ potential to ‘Fund What Matters’? Where
is the TAM very large now, and what design spaces
have billion $$$ potential next cycle? Which will only
be enabled by new UX breakthroughs (like PWAs,
gasless apps, account abstraction)?
Would we be served well by building/researching
many of these tools internally, or enabling 1000s of
devs to build in these design spaces, on top of Allo?
And perhaps finding (3,3s) with these builders?
Right now Gitcoin Grants Lab is focused on
Grants-centric mechanisms. But there is a roadmap
beyond that, which we call Grants+ and Grants++ for
things that are over the horizon.

M E C H A N I S M TA X O N O M Y

197

IN CLOSING
In this chapter, we reasoned about how the design
space for Funding What Matters has evolved so far.
We attempted to sketch out what a taxonomy of
mechanisms might look like. We then visualized it.
From there, we made some educated guesses about
what other types of experiments for Funding What
Matters may exist in the future. The design space is
vast, and we expect it will be cartographied emergently as it is explored in the coming years.
I hope that articulating these dimensions of self-similarity between mechanisms helps orient you into the
rapidly evolving world of onchain capital allocation.
There is still much to do to cartography the design
space, build taxonomies, and build awareness of
these mechansisms. I hope to see members of this
books telegram community step up and help each
other progressively elaborate the design space together. Maybe this book will become a shelling point
for those efforts :)

SLIME MOLDS
ARE A SOURCE OF
INSPIRATION
Slime molds are a source of inspiration for me
because they are a networked organism. This makes
them a rich source of biomimetic inspiration for how
to design DAOs. Some may even say your DAO is a
slime mold.
Slime molds have a unique and fascinating method
of finding food. They do not have a brain or central
nervous system, but they use a form of spatial memory and optimized search patterns.
When a slime mold encounters a food source like
bacteria, fungal spores, or decaying organic matter,
it forms a network of tube-like structures, or pseudopodia, to engulf and absorb the nutrients. As it
moves, it leaves behind a trail of extracellular slime.
This slime trail plays a critical role in the organism’s
search for food. It acts as a memory system, allowing
the slime mold to avoid revisiting areas it has already
explored. This efficient search strategy, where it
extends its network towards unexplored areas while
retracting from nutrient-poor or already explored
regions, enables slime molds to find the most direct
routes to food sources and optimize their foraging
efficiency. Remarkably, this simple organism can
solve complex mazes and spatial problems to locate
food, demonstrating a form of intelligence and problem-solving ability without a brain.

SLIME MOLD

201

HOW DOES THIS
APPLY TO US?
We are economic agents searching for value in a
multidimensional design space with multiple billion
$$$ opportunities to build new crowdfunding mechanisms/applications within it.

billion $$ oppy?

billion $$ oppy?

billion $$ oppy?

As we traverse this design space, we can be mindful
of the two modes slime molds have when looking for
resources:
1. Explore - how do we find the resources?
2. Enrich - how do we use the resources when we
find them?

SLIME MOLD

202

1. EXPLORE
How do we find the biggest (ideally billion $$$ +)
opportunities?
Memory - In biology, the slime trail plays a critical
role in the organism’s search for food. It acts as a
memory system, allowing the slime mold to avoid
revisiting areas it has already explored.
Perhaps the lesson for us here could be to learn in
public. What if we created some sort of memory
system wherein we (or anyone else in the regen
space) learns about something new and important,
they publish it. We could all then benefit from each
other’s explorations of the design space. Groups like
regenlearnings.xyz can serve this purpose.
Efficiency - The slime mold’s efficient search strategy, where it extends its network towards unexplored
areas while moving on from from nutrient-poor or
already explored regions, enables slime molds to find
the most direct routes to food sources and optimize
their foraging efficiency.
Perhaps the lesson for us here could be to search
efficiently and in parallel. We should retract from nutrient poor regions. We should be lean as we explore
new design spaces. In particular, I think its really
exciting how new Allo Protocol-enabled apps can be
created in a matter of days/weeks.

2. ENRICH
When a slime mold finds food, such as bacteria or
organic particles, it engulfs these particles using a
part of its cell membrane. This process is known as

SLIME MOLD

203

phagocytosis. Essentially, the slime mold surrounds
and encapsulates the food source with its membrane, creating a small internal pocket or vacuole.
Enzymes are then secreted into this vacuole to
break down the food into smaller, absorbable nutrients. These nutrients are absorbed into the slime
mold’s cytoplasm, providing energy and materials
for growth. This method allows the slime mold to
efficiently process a variety of food sources in its
environment.

Takeaways
1. The tactics used in finding
resources are completely
different than those used once
they have been found.

2. Engulf the problem and
break it down into composite
parts.

3. The resources we invest into
finding/exploiting opportunities should be relative to how
big the resources we find are.

EXPLORATION SO FAR
The design space we are aware of
so far, as identified by Gitcoin DAO,
includes three resource-rich areas:
QF

RetroPGF

TAM of ~ $20m/year - Located
in the democratic and sybil-resistant part of the design.

TAM of ~ $100m/year - Located in the retroactive part of the
design space.

SLIME MOLD

204

Direct Grants
TAM of ~$10-100m/year Located in the “simple” part of
the design space.

The Grants Labs team is working within those opportunities.
Yet, there is a lot of potential in the design space
we’ve not yet explored yet. But the ecosystem is
exploring those areas in parallel to the threads focused on the known opportunities (QF, Direct Grants,
RetroPGF).

DESIGNING
FROM FUNGAL
FOUNDATIONS
In our search for regenerative economic design
patterns, the answers we seek may be hidden right
beneath our feet. Over billions of years of evolution,
mushrooms - and the underground mycelial networks to which they belong - have been iterating
design patterns for distributed, autonomous infrastructures used for intelligent resource distribution
and collective signaling between countless living
organisms worldwide. Decades of study into the
interaction patterns of mycelial networks in natural
ecologies have offered us a glimpse into a cooperative underground world where resources flow
dynamically between flora, fauna, and funga to generate thriving ecosystems. If web3 technology holds
the potential to craft new economic paradigms,
mycelial design patterns may just show us the way
back to a more ecological future.

MYCELIUM = NATURE’S
PUBLIC GOODS
INFRASTRUCTURE
As one of the oldest and largest organisms alive,
mycelium is a grand architect of nature. Fungi were
among the planet’s earliest multicellular
lifeforms, and along with their algae symbiotes,
they terraformed Planet Earth from a ball of cooled

MYCOFI

208

magma into the green paradise we know today.
Mycelia form underground in a structure of networked tubes, which provide the “pipes” for a
large proportion of nutrient distribution within and
between most plants worldwide. From the earliest
days of life on earth, fungi have been breaking rock
and networking through the soil, building a vast and
interconnected mesh across the face of the planet.
Like most well-operating public goods infrastructure, they remain underground and almost entirely
invisible, even as they serve as a keystone network
of species sustaining life on earth.

MYCOFI IS ECONOMIC
BIOMIMICRY
MyCoFi is a movement to consciously apply lessons
from the mycelial world to cryptoeconomics, and
encourage web3 builders to “think like a mushroom”
about the systems they are designing. Incorporating
nature’s evolutionary design patterns into our economies could alleviate much of the disharmony we see
between human economies and nature’s ecologies,
gesturing towards a future of economic permaculture. This is also the basic premise of ecological
economics - that we must move away from singular
notions of value and orient our economies to reflect
the interdependent coevolution of multiple forms of
value flows, just as we see in nature.

BLOCKCHAINS
ARE COORDINATIVE
INFRASTRUCTURES
One of the core value propositions of blockchain
technology is based on the use of distributed network architectures to serve as coordination substrates for new forms of organizing. This offers us
a unique opportunity to rethink many of the power
asymmetries we see in legacy systems, some of
which were the inspiration for blockchain technology
in the fi rst place. Every time technology has opened
a path toward new coordinative infrastructures from
the printing press to the telegraph, to the internet,
the world has experienced massive shifts in geopolitical structure. Distributed ledger technology holds
the same potential for paradigmatic and socio-evolutionary shifts.

DAOS AS DIGITAL FUNGI
Mammals are more closely related to fungi than to
any other kingdom of life. A key difference is that
while mammals internalize digestion by putting food
into their bodies, mycelia externalize it by putting
their bodies into the food, breaking down and consuming the environment around them. Some of the
nutrients are absorbed and transported throughout
the mycelial network to other organisms, while other
nutrients are left to enrich the soil, enabling new life
to form and thrive. When a mushroom feasts, it is
a communal banquet, a public good for the whole
ecology.
In contrast to mammalian private corporations that

MYCOFI

211

MYCOFI

212

enclose resources and intellectual property within
the boundaries of the firm, DAOs could be considered the mycelia of the digital world; they network
amongst themselves and expand into emergent
collaborations to build shared value through opensource tooling and an ethos of permissionless
participation.

If we were to ask this ancient, sentient network its secrets, perhaps it
would whisper to us of design patterns it has iterated in the depths of
deep time, patterns such as:
Network Infrastructure

Fractal Nature

“We are the mycelial networks,
the ancient weavers of nature’s
oldest decentralized web.
Our threads stretch across
the world, silently sharing resources with all, creating life’s
sustaining mesh.”

“In us, the fractal patterns of
the cosmos are echoed. With
minimal energy, we replicate
these universal designs of
self-similarity, from
the smallest seashell to the
vastest galaxysustaining
mesh.”

Adaptive Sense and
Response

Mutual Reciprocity

“At the edge of the known, we,
the mycelium, innovate without
requiring permission from our
ancient roots. Here we thrive,
at the frontier, adapting to the
mysteries of life’s sustaining
mesh.”

“In our world, a delicate balance of give-and-take prevails.
We, the fungi, alongside flora
and fauna, partake in a life-sustaining dance, each exchange
nurturing the reciprocal cycle
of existence.”

MYCOFI

213

Polycentric Pluralism

Dynamic Flow

“Within us thrives diversity, a
celebration of life’s myriad of
forms. Responsive and varied,
each part of our network contributes its unique voice to the
chorus of nature.”

“Our network pulses with
life, a never-ending flow of
resources. Like a symphony,
nourishment courses through
us, shared freely, never still,
never hoarded.”

“In our search for regenerative economic design patterns, the answers
we seek may be hidden right beneath
our feet.” - MyCoFi book

EPHEMERAL DAOS

EPHEMERAL DAOS:
VEHICLES FOR FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION
Ephemeral DAOs exist for a finite period of time to
achieve specific goals or objectives. Once the goals
or objectives of the Ephemeral DAO have been
achieved, the DAO is dissolved, and its assets, if any,
are distributed back to the participants or transferred to another entity.
Ephemerality and
DAO-iness are powerful
because:

We can learn from decentralized movements of the past,
many of which ebbed and
flowed, (Occupy Wall St or the
Civil Rights movement are two
examples) and transcribe their
lessons into our ephemeral
DAO experiments.

Without the burden of having
to last forever, we can make
more pragmatic decisions
about what to do over a short
period of time without worrying about entrenching power.

Without the burden of having
to last forever, the stakes are
lower, which enables more

Projects like Meta Cartel,

(other capital allocation

There is a spectrum of “how much longevity is baked
into each Ephemeral DAO?” Ephemeral DAOs can
be shorter lasting (like a SealOrg Whitehat op which
could be hours-long) or longer lasting (or MetaCartel,
which wound down after several years).

The faster the Ephemeral DAOs lifecycle, the faster
designers can spin its OODA Loop. The loop of Observe Orient Decide Act is how mechanism designers can iterate towards their potential. Iteration is
the key to Ephemeral DAOs becoming evolutionary.
By launching ephemeral DAOs that last for only a
short amount of time, then tweaking their designs,
and then launching the next one, DAO designers can
iterate towards a design goal. Here is a visual example of how Public Goods Funding rounds (each is a
Ephemeral DAO) can be evolutionary experiments
creating more value over time through learning and
iteration.

From the perspective of this evolution, software
communities like Gitcoin are kind of an Ephemeral DAO factory. Gitcoin launches Grants rounds
(Ephemeral DAOs) and then round over round,
tweaking the protocols they run on to launch progressively better and better Ephemeral DAOs.
Ephemeral DAOs exemplify a transformative frontier
in the realm of decentralized organizations, where
the temporary nature of these entities not only
promotes innovation but also allows for agile, purpose-driven engagements that dissolve upon goal
completion.
This design strategy minimizes long-term commitments and facilitates rapid experimentation and
learning, offering a fresh perspective on collaborative efforts and governance.
This design strategy relies on extituons (soft things
like culture and relationships) over institutions (har
things likesmart contracts) in some ways. Like other
networked organisms, there is a symbiosis between
the soft parts and the hard parts as the design
space is traversed.
As this underexplored space continues to evolve, it
holds the promise of reshaping our understanding of
collective action and organizational life cycles in the
digital age.

The DAO of DAOs is the structure

AN EXAMPLE (2020)
One example of DAO of DAOs is the structure of Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool sponsors from GR7-GR15.
Each sponsorship of the matching pool that supports Ethereum public goods weaves the ecosystem
together into a mesh network of relationships.

As DAOs begin to specialize and mature, there will
be many opportunities for mutually beneficial DAO to

and so on..

A RECENT EXAMPLE (2023)
Another example of a DAO of DAOs is the network
of public goods funding organizations that have
evolved in order to fund public goods in the ethereum ecosystem. Together, these projects form a
mesh network of different mechanisms, memes, and
economics to support Ethereum ecosystem public
goods. This is an example of “stacking mechanisms

THREE LAYERS TO A DAO
TO DAO PARTNERSHIP
There are three layers to a DAO to DAO partnership.
In order from more casual to more serious (from less
commitment to more commitment).

1.SOCIAL
INTEROPERABILITY
In this stage, there are strong relationships being
built between members of each DAO across DAO.
A Gitcoin example: DAO members might be invited
to speak at Gitcoin events like Schelling Point or
our Public Goods are Good Twitter spaces, or DAO
Vibes. This is the relationship/rapport/trust building
stage of of a DAO-to-DAO partnership.

2.PRODUCT/TECHNOLOGY
INTEROPERABILITY
The product/technology interop stage is when the
DAOs start to invest resources into seriously building
protocol and tooling interop between the products
of each system.
Examples of
this I’ve seen at
GitcoinDAO

1. Gitcoin leverages Proof of
Humanity, BrightID or Idena for
Gitcoin Grants.

2. Developers building on top
of Allo Protocol or participating in the Capital Allocation
Srategy Exchange.

3. Gitcoin launches a podcast
on the Bankless network.

(I’m sure there are many
others).

DAO OF DAOS

225

3.ECONOMIC INTEROP
Economic Interop occurs when DAOs begin to share
economics with each other.
This can occur as a rev share or as a token swap
between the entities.
Examples that we’ve
seen or hope to see:

1. Gitcoin and Radicle doing a
token swap.

2. Rev share agreements on
Allo Protocol.

3. Stablecoins that fund public
goods like gtcUSD.

IN CONCLUSION
DAO to DAO partnerships are the atomic building
block of a DAO of DAOS.
The DAO of DAOs is the harbringer of the transition
from single ceullar to multi-cellullar life for the web3
ecosystem. By specializing and interoperating with
others, we will build a mesh network of projects that
rise and fall together - both by coordinating within
themselves and between each other.

As Gitcoin evolves into becoming a capital allocation
strategy exchange, the DAO of DAOs is an explicit
part of the strategy. By allowing others to explore
the design space and then finding a (3, 3) with them/
Gitcoin, we strengthen Gitcoin as an attractor for the
regen movement. This cycle could reflexively feed on
itself and accelerate over time.

WITH ALLO PROTOCOL

A LLO P R OTO C O L

227

As of June 2024, Gitcoin has run 20 rounds of its
Quadratic Funding grants program, and has distributed over $60M to early-stage builders and other
grantees.
Gitcoin’s capital allocation protocol, Allo Protocol,
launched in early 2023 and has powered the Gitcoin
Grants program ever since. In this chapter, we go indepth into Allo, which marks a strategic cornerstone
of Gitcoin’s approach to facilitating more dynamic,
pluralistic, and inclusive funding models. Allo’s
architecture is designed for extensibility, supporting
a diverse array of allocation strategies such as Direct
Grants, Retroactive Public Goods Funding, Quadratic
Funding, and many future mechanisms.
By leveraging Gitcoin’s momentum and by building
and proliferating capital allocation strategies, we
aim to surmount the limitations faced by traditional
capital allocation practices - often hindered by a
lack of transparency, democratic participation, and
accessibility.
As tokenization eats the world, our ambition is to
enhance our collective capability to finance critical
endeavors and create collective action across various fields. We envision Allo Protocol as an engine of
exploration of this space. By stewarding a core repository of the best allocation strategies, rigorously
audited and well-documented smart contracts, best
practices, a social movement that leverages these
tools, and other supporting collateral - we position
Allo as a pivotal player in the decentralized capital
allocation space.
This chapter investigates the opportunities enabled
by Allo, and articulates a pluralistic ecology of capital
allocation tools, methodologies, and culture. We en-

A LLO P R OTO C O L

228

vision a diversity of types of capital allocation which
enable collective action for different combinations of
peoples, cultures, and causes.
For web3 developers and participants, the advancement of Gitcoin and the rollout of Allo represent new
opportunities in the pursuit of more equitable and
effective capital distribution mechanisms.
We now have programmable money, so we can
program our values into our money. We can build
capital allocation systems that solve the problems
of preciseness, scale, and remove gatekeepers. We
can build democratic, accessible, transparent, and
powerful capital allocation systems.
Gitcoin 2.0 is well positioned to help facilitate this
vision. Throughout the distribution of $60M to builders through the Gitcoin Grants program, we’ve witnessed the immense impact of capital allocation in
action. Organizations that are able to make effective
funding decisions to invest in their ecosystem see
higher builder activity, user onboarding, and transaction volumes – in short: grants create growth.

Driven by these learnings, we’ve recently launched Gitcoin 2.0. Gitcoin’s
transformation from 1.0 to 2.0 breaks
down as the following:
Transformation from Ethereum-only to being deployed
across many EVM-based
networks (Optimism, Arbitrum,
Base, Polygon, zkSync, Scroll,
Avalanche, and more).

Transformation from only
Quadratic Funding to many
types of capital allocation
mechanisms (Quadratic Funding, Direct Grants, Retroactive
Public Goods Funding, and
more).

Transformation from a centralized, Gitcoin-operated platform
to a suite of modularized products and protocols that anyone
can use and build on top of.

DESIGN
PHILOSOPHY
Throughout the design and development of Gitcoin’s
tech stack, we’ve adhered to a design philosophy
grounded in key principles. These tenets are crucial
for capturing our understanding of the broad spectrum of capital allocation design, yet they maintain
the flexibility needed as we, along with others
venturing into this domain, continue to learn and
innovate.

1. SECURITY FIRST
Allo Protocol brings capital allocation onchain. We
believe that this is a foundationally important step
forward for the capital allocation ecosystem because
it means we can now introduce credible neutrality,

A LLO P R OTO C O L

230

censorship resistance, and democratic decision-making into capital allocation schemes.

2. SIMPLE CORE, RICH
PERIPHERY
This tenant of the Allo design philosophy is how we
express the Unix philosophy in the protocol. The core
of the protocol (Allo.sol) creates and funds pools
and assigns them an allocation strategy (“make each
program do one thing well”).
We expect (and hope) that the output of an allocation strategy will be used for a variety of things,
including potentially funding other pools in Allo
(“expect the output of every program to become the
input to another, as yet unknown, program”).

We have designed Allo to have
a simple, stable, and secure, core of
four modules.
These modules follow the Unix Philosophy of doing
one thing and doing it well, but being interoperable
with each other. This has allowed us to effectively,
precisely, and scalable allocate capital.

THE BASIC MODULES
OF ALLO’S SIMPLE
CORE ARE:
Strategy - how to distribute
capital to the projects in the
registry.

Registry - list of projects
that could be funded.

Allo - the central nexus which
coheres the above three
elements together.

into Allo.

REGISTRY
Allo serves as a protocol for capital allocation tailored for tokenized communities, featuring a novel
concept of a registry of projects.
The registry stands as a core foundation of data
intelligence regarding the activities of projects, individuals involved, their reputation, and attestations
about their impact.

STRATEGY
Capital allocation strategies decide where tokens
should go - often with the help of outside data, especially voting data.
The strategy is the core foundation of computation
that takes data from the registry and other impact
oracles, and computes a distribution of tokens.
Which is then given to a seperate distribution contract.
Each of these modules is overridable. From this
simple core, a rich periphery is enabled. We hope
Allo eventually supports (and provides off-the-shelf
to builders) many possible permutations of capital
allocation registries, tokens, and strategies.

It is our belief that all permutations of this possibility
space = (sum of all possible aqueducts) x (sum of all
possible onchain assets) x (sum of all possible registries) x (sum of all strategies).
The design space here is vast. We anticipate that
there will be many valuable configurations of Allo
Protocol in the future.

THIS DESIGN SPACE
INCLUDES:
All possible tokens.
All possible project
registries.
All possible aqueducts.
All possible strategies.

INCLUDING..
1. Strategies that Allo already supports (Direct

2. Strategies that Allo could support (many of which
are detailed in this book!)

Exploring the design space through brute force–
testing every possible model permutation– is inefficient.
Instead, we refine our strategies by running Allo
funding rounds and learning from the outcomes,
employing an iterative OODA loop (Observe, Orient,
Decide, Act) process that has previously matured
Gitcoin Grants Stack and the Gitcoin Grants program.

While we endeavour to find the optimal designs for
capital allocation strategies, we are mindful that
there is not global optimal design. Instead, it is our
belief that the design space is pluralistic. There will

are good at differnet things.

2023 was the year that Gitcoin fell to 3rd place in
the ETH public goods funding space. Measured by
volume, Gitcoin’s distribution ($7m) was surpassed
by Protocol Guild ($10m) and Optimism ($100m).
In 2019-2020, Gitcoin was a darling of the Ethereum
ecosystem. Powered by Quadratic Funding—a novel
mechanism at the time—Gitcoin gained prominence
as one of the top crowdfunding platforms in the
Ethereum ecosystem.
But it was not meant to last. Gitcoin transitioned
slowly from company to DAO, and the market moved
on from QF to RetroPGF, Self Curated Registries,
and more.

where capital allocation strategies (CAS) are exchanged.
It has three primary personas it attracts with distinct jobs

AN ESSAY BY AURYN
MACMILLAN (CLRFUND)
& KEVIN OWOCKI (GITCOIN)
The Ethereum network is secured by block producers (currently miners, soon to be replaced by validators). They are the foundation of consensus in the
Ethereum network, upon which there are trillions of
dollars of assets and untold untapped potential for
human coordination.
Having well-designed, secure, and dependable block
producers to protect this value is a great strategy to
defend the network.
One of the key strategies employed by the Ethereum community to ensure secure and reliable block
production is client diversity. This means, more than
one implementation of the specification — they can
be differentiated by language, architecture, features
or which part of the network they specialize in. If a
single client were used by 2/3rds (66%) of validators and it experienced a serious bug, there’s a very
real risk this could lead to chain instability for users
and monetary loss for node operators. By treating
client diversity as a public good and fostering an
environment where many independent client teams
are incentivized to implement the Ethereum protocol
in disparate code bases, the Ethereum community
bakes in a measure of anti-fragility and resilience
against bugs in any one implementation.

P R ACTI CA L P LU R A LI S M

Client Diversity is pluralism in practice (x axis — time, y axis — resource
availability)

1. ANTIFRAGILE 2. RESILIENT 3. ROBUST 4. FRAGILE

Pluralism — the understanding that diversity of
people, beliefs, opinions, mechanisms, approaches,
implementations, etc., within a given context generally results in better outcomes than in the absence
of such diversity. Nowhere is this more evident than
in ecosystems with rich biodiversity; ecosystems
where radically different flora and fauna work in a
harmoniously competitive act of mutual regulation
and perpetuation. This can be seen in how the
success of one species feeds and is kept in check by
the success of another species, and so on.
Pluralism itself is a primitive for antifragile, resilient,
and regenerative systems. As an ecosystem, Ethereum has done a great job fostering diversity in its mining and validating clients. Similarly, we should insist
on pluralism across the full stack of web3 technologies and culture. This includes discrete products like
wallets, RPC nodes, DAO tooling, public goods funding mechanisms, AMMs, stablecoins, and developer
tooling, as well as the intangibles influences like the
people, groups, communities, and opinions which
participate in and hold sway over our ecosystem.

248

We are writing this essay because we believe in
client diversity. We believe in pluralism as a primitive.
And we want you to join us in extending the ethos
of client diversity and pluralism to other layers of the
stack. By having pluralism as a core value of each
vertical, we make it more likely the space tends towards capture-resistance — not fragility. Participants
should be able to choose to use or not use any one
of a number of options for any given need.
By having pluralism at the heart of each niche, we
ensure the space is antifragile. If there is a major bug
discovered in one system, the resulting cascading
harm can only go so far because there will always be
another dApp ready to pick up the slack. For web3
to truly express itself, diversity and pluralism must be
core values.
To all those who would seek to build, enshrine, and
defend moats in our shared virtual machine, to build
systems incapable of composition, incapable of componentization, incapable of being permissionlessly
replaced by some alternative:
We say this is a pattern of the past, an antipattern in
web3. It’s a pattern enabled by permissioned access
to, and control of, data.
This pattern will be made redundant in our version of
the internet, made redundant by our shared virtual
machine.
The future will be dominated by much more emergent systems; organic compositions of many
discrete and interchangeable components, built by
disparate people, in combinations never dreamt of by
their creators.

The future will be dominated by much more emergent systems; organic compositions of many
discrete and interchangeable components, built by
disparate people, in combinations never dreamt of by
their creators.
It is through this diversity that we build anti-fragility,
and a resilience to capture, censorship, and stagnation.
We challenge the protocols at the center of the NFT,
DeFi, DAO Tooling ecosystems to adopt practical
pluralism as part of their design philosophy & broader Ethos.

IT’S ALL
COORDINATION
The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a classic problem in game
theory, illustrating why two rational individuals might
not coordinate, even if it seems to be in their best
interest. In the scenario, two prisoners are accused
of a crime and must decide independently whether
to confess or remain silent. If both remain silent, they
receive light sentences. If one confesses while the
other remains silent, the confessor gets a lenient
sentence while the silent one gets a harsh sentence.
If both confess, they receive moderate sentences.
The dilemma highlights how individual incentives
can lead to a worse collective outcome.

collaboration. This would lead to more efficient and
mutually beneficial outcomes in various fields such
as economics, politics, and social interactions. Enhanced cooperation could reduce conflicts, increase
collective problem-solving, and create more equitable and sustainable systems, ultimately improving
overall societal welfare and stability.

I think that each of the onchain coordination mechanisms in this book create new ways of solving the
Prisoners Dilemna. Used together, they could provide
overwhelming momentum for coordination and collective action (but without sacrificing sovereignty).

The capital allocation strategies denoted in this book are all working in
the tradeoff space of:

Principal vs agent
(as in principal agent
problem)

Mutualism vs
elitism

Coordination vs defection
(as in Prisoner’s Dilemma)

Individualism vs
collectivism

Centralization vs
decentralization

Commons vs
private

This tradeoff space is active at many
levels of the universe at different
scales (cells, organs, organisms, families, organizations, companies, etc.),
and in some spots it veers into coordination failure.

Let’s reason about these varying
levels of scale. But first, some vocabulary:
A holon is a system or entity that is both a whole
in itself and a part of a larger system. Each of the
capital allocation strategies that we’ve discussed in
these pages are a way of ordering the relationship
between holons - up and down the holarchy. A holarchy is a hierarchical structure where each level is
composed of holons that are both whole entities and
parts of a larger system.
Now that we’ve got blockchains - a better substrate
for human coordination - will we be able to create
better systems for human coordination? Can we
solve coordination failures in human families, communities, cities, states, countries, or globally?
This is my theory of change: blockchains offer an
unprecedently effective medium for navigating
coordination failures and experimenting in new ways
to harmonize the individual within their collective
and vice versa, between individual humans (and their
bots), all of humanity, and every level of the stack
between them.
What if we could offer better ways of coordinating
groups, whilst still respecting the sovereignty of
the individual? What if we could solve for these
tradeoffs in one part of the stack and easily proliferate that to other parts of the stack? If we can’t
solve it, we could at least make forward progress to
align incentives, rights, and privileges in new, more
elegant ways.

If you consider all of the different holons you are a
part of, you may notice how much of your relations
between other humans are mediated by ineffective
coordination.

IN CLOSING
The greatest pleasure of writing this book was to
showcase all of the powerful ways we are provoking
a new social contract between the individual and the
collective. Each of the onchain coordination networks in this book are embodiments of this potential.
At the same time as we recognize this tradeoff
space and work to solve for it, we must realize also
individualism vs collectivism are a false dualism.
You are both an individual human and a collective
(of cells). When you realize that cancer and climate
change are driven by the same phenomena—coordination failures (Moloch)—just at different parts of the
stack, you will see this false dualism at work.

Our task is to integrate globally shared knowledge
(like the mechanisms we invent in the Ethereum
space) with localized trust networks (like our communities) to create sustainable and resilient communities. This is the vision of Cosmolocalism - a new
movement that recognizes where globalization has
failed and aims to combine the best parts of the
global with the local.

What if we could cross-pollinate world-class capital allocation strategies (globalism) with the deep
legitimacy, high lindy, and rich relationality of local
communities (localism)?
