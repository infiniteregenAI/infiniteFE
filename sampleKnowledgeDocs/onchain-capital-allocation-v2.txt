INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the second edition of “Onchain Capital
Allocation HandBook,”. This book is an accessible
exploration of the rapidly evolving landscape of
resource distribution in both traditional and blockchain-based systems. Our goal is to empower the
creators of systems aimed at collective impact and
to assist organizations in selecting the most suitable
models by offering real-world implementations and
adaptations.
This book builds on its predecessor, offering a
more interconnected view of capital allocation with
diverse themes and models. In addition to funding
mechanisms, it includes governance and cooperative
strategies. Governance tools like multi-signature
wallets and voting systems ensure fair management
of decentralized organizations, while cooperative
mechanisms provide frameworks for shared ownership and equitable capital flows. These pages offer
valuable insights for developers, grant operators, and
anyone intrigued by the future of capital allocation.
We’ve curated a rich tapestry of capital allocation
methods, from time-tested traditional models to
cutting-edge blockchain innovations, offering a comprehensive look at how resources can be distributed
more effectively and transparently in both conventional and onchain systems.

WHY ONCHAIN
CAPITAL ALLOCATION?
Every time you make a decision about how to spend
money, you are allocating capital. At scale, venture
capitalists and grant administrators allocate billions
of dollars in capital yearly.
The internet transformed how information is routed
in society, fundamentally altering everything that
relies on information (such as news, entertainment,
and social media). Now, with the advent of blockchains, there is an opportunity to transform how
society routes value, which could fundamentally
change how we allocate capital. Now that we can
program our values into our money, can we build
resource allocation networks that better serve their
constituents?
Onchain capital allocation represents a transformative shift from traditional, centralized methods of
resource distribution. This shift is crucial because
it breaks down long-standing barriers to capital
access, empowering communities to take charge of
resource allocation and aligning incentives toward
collective, positive social outcomes. By embracing
decentralized mechanisms, we enter an era where
financial decisions are no longer confined to gatekeepers, and resource distribution becomes more
democratic and equitable.
Innovations in the onchain era, including many men-

INTRO D U CTI O N

tioned in this book, are poised to revolutionize how
public goods and regenerative projects are funded.
These mechanisms leverage blockchain’s trustless,
transparent nature to bring a new level of efficiency
and fairness to capital allocation.
For example, Quadratic Funding allows small individual donations to have a large impact by amplifying
the collective contributions of many, while Retro
Funding rewards impactful work after it has been
demonstrated, ensuring that the best ideas receive
resources based on widespread perceptions that
they provide value. Onchain approaches to capital
allocation enable communities to collectively decide
where resources are most needed.
The opportunity size of onchain capital allocation
cannot be overstated. Traditional capital allocation systems route $trillions, yet often suffer from
inefficiencies, opaque decision-making processes,
and limited access to capital for those outside elite
decision making networks. By leveraging blockchain
technology, decentralized systems enable a more
inclusive and community-driven process. They align
financial incentives with positive social outcomes,
creating resilient ecosystems where resources are
directed toward public goods that benefit the many,
not just the few. By empowering communities to
take ownership of capital distribution, these systems foster innovation, collaboration, and long-term
sustainability.
This book focuses on practical, real-world mechanisms for implementing decentralized capital allocation. It delves into the design space of emerging
mechanisms like Buidl Guild Streams, LottoPGF, and
other innovative models, offering a comprehensive
guide for individuals and organizations looking to ex-

INTRO D U CTI O N

plore and experiment with these tools. By providing
a hands-on approach, the book encourages readers
to actively engage with these mechanisms, experimenting and contributing to the broader decentralized movement. It serves as both a guide and a call
to action, inviting readers to become part of the next
frontier in capital allocation—one where transparency,
fairness, and community empowerment are at the
core.
As you explore the concepts and case studies in
this book, you are invited to contribute to a growing
ecosystem of hackers, dreamers, and doers that seek
to reimagine how capital can be distributed better in
the onchain era. This is more than just a theoretical
exploration; it’s a movement focused on making tangible, lasting change through onchain capital allocation.
Together, we’ll uncover the next horizon of capital allocation, sharing our findings and effectively traversing
this new landscape.

TL;DR
PIONEERED BY PORTO ALEGRE’S
WORKERS’ PARTY

Participatory Budgeting serves as a capital allocation funding mechanism by enabling community
members to directly decide how a portion of public
funds is distributed.

View on Allo.Expert

This process was pioneered in 1989 when Porto
Alegre’s Workers’ Party introduced a democratic
process that empowered residents to actively participate in the allocation of public funds, particularly focusing on supporting disadvantaged neighborhoods.

PA R T I C I PAT O R Y B U D G E T I N G

PA R T I C I PAT O R Y B U D G E T I N G

19

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
Participatory Budgeting is best suited for municipalities, communities, and organizations that want
to empower their members in the decision-making
process regarding public spending.

FUNDING STRATEGY
The participatory budgeting funding strategy
focuses on allocating a specific portion of a public
or organizational budget directly to the community
for decision-making. This method allows community
members to propose and vote on projects they believe will enhance their neighborhoods, ensuring that
funding aligns with local interests.

PA R T I C I PAT O R Y B U D G E T I N G

20

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The participatory budgeting process starts by allocating funds, usually from municipal or organizational
budgets, and inviting community members to submit
their ideas. This process involves several stages.
First, community members propose projects they
believe will address local needs. These proposals
are then assessed for feasibility by experts or city
officials to ensure realistic implementation. After
refinement, the projects are presented to the public
for voting. Residents vote on the proposals, and the
most favored ones receive funding. This approach
ensures that public spending reflects community
priorities, promoting transparency and active civic
engagement. It not only democratizes the budgeting
process but also builds transparency and trust by
allowing citizens to directly influence how funds are
allocated.

Community-Driven
Decision Making

Participatory budgeting gives residents direct power to propose
and vote on how public funds are allocated, ensuring the process
reflects local needs and priorities.

Transparency and
Accountability

The entire budgeting process is open, allowing citizens to track
the progress of proposals, vote outcomes, and how funds are
spent, fostering trust between the community and governing
bodies.

BOUNTIES

25

TL;DR
POPULARIZED BY HUNTER AND READY,
NETSCAPE COMMUNICATIONS
CORPORATION

Bounties function as a capital allocation mechanism
by offering rewards for completing specific project
tasks, facilitating decentralized crowdsourcing and
efficient resource allocation.

View on Allo.Expert

Notable early adopters include Hunter and Ready,
who launched the first known bug bounty initiative
in 1983. Netscape Communications Corporation
followed in 1995 with a widely recognized bug
bounty program​. This program set a precedent for
using bounties to improve software security and
quality. Since then, bounties have evolved and are
now widely adopted by web3 projects, open-source
initiatives, and decentralized organizations to incentivize contributions across various fields, including
development, marketing, and governance.

BOUNTIES

26

BOUNTIES

27

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is particularly beneficial for software developers, open-source projects, and various protocols. Widely adopted in open-source
development and illustrated by prominent web3
projects, this model effectively channels resources
into solving specific issues and constructing project
infrastructure.

FUNDING STRATEGY
Bounties are reward-based mechanisms designed to
incentivize the completion of specific project tasks,
with funding released upon the approval of deliverables. While commonly associated with hackathons,
bounties also operate independently, offering flexibility in capital allocation and engagement across a
wide range of projects.

BOUNTIES

28

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Bounties are created when a project identifies
specific tasks and issues Requests for Proposals
(RFPs) for their completion. Participants complete
these tasks, known as bounties, and receive compensation upon approval. Common types include
bug bounties, which focus on fixing vulnerabilities,
and general bounties, which encourage new features
or contributions. This approach allows projects to allocate resources efficiently, ensuring that funds are
directed toward specific outcomes and contributors
are compensated only after successfully delivering
on tasks.

B LO C K R E WA R D S

33

TL;DR
ORIGINATED BY SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

Block rewards function as a funding mechanism by
incentivizing network participants, like miners, with
tokens for validating transactions and securing the
blockchain.

View on Allo.Expert

Introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 for Proofof-Work (PoW) systems, block rewards give miners
transferable tokens as compensation for validating
transactions and securing the blockchain. This
mechanism, now also used in Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
systems, helps sustain ecosystem growth and fosters community-driven engagement.

B LO C K R E WA R D S

34

B LO C K R E WA R D S

35

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is ideal for developers building
decentralized protocols, those overseeing mining
or staking systems, and node stakers seeking to
earn rewards by supporting network security and
validation. It’s particularly suited for decentralized
networks aiming to maintain security and incentivize
participation.

FUNDING STRATEGY
In the block reward mechanism, cryptocurrencies
are allocated to miners or validators based on their
contribution to block validation. The first to validate
a block receives the reward, incentivizing swift and
accurate network participation.

B LO C K R E WA R D S

36

HOW DOES IT WORK?
In blockchain networks, transactions are grouped
into blocks. In Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, miners
use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems that validate and secure these
transactions. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, like
Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Cosmos, use token staking instead of computational power for validation.
The first miner or validator to successfully validate
a block is rewarded with cryptocurrency. Block
rewards typically decrease over time through “halving” events, reducing inflation. Some networks, like
Ethereum post-EIP-1559, implement more complex
models combining fee burning, staking, and reduced
issuance.
In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, rewards extend beyond block validation to include transaction fees and
newly minted tokens. These rewards are sometimes
divided between validators and a community treasury, which funds ecosystem development. Governance mechanisms, sometimes involving token-holder voting, oversee the allocation of treasury funds.

TL;DR
INTRODUCED BY KEVIN OWOCKI AND
ZAK COLE

EIP-6969 incentivizes continuous development
and maintenance of decentralized infrastructure by
rewarding smart contract deployers on L2 networks
with revenue when their contracts are used.

View on Allo.Expert

First introduced by Kevin Owocki and Zak Cole and
proposed in May 2023, the mechanism was inspired
by the Contract-Secured Revenue (CSR) model used
on the Canto blockchain.

EIP 6969

42

EIP 6969

43

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
EIP-6969 is ideal for Ethereum-based projects,
DAOs, and Layer 2 protocols. By offering a transparent and continuous compensation model, it ensures
developers are rewarded for their contributions to
infrastructure, making it a valuable tool for incentivizing long-term development and maintenance.

FUNDING STRATEGY
EIP-6969 introduces a smart contract-based revenue-sharing mechanism, allowing developers to
receive a portion of gas fees generated through
interactions with their contracts. This approach
directs resources toward infrastructure growth, compensating developers based on real usage rather
than speculative funding models.

EIP 6969

44

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Upon deploying a smart contract, a developer’s
address is linked to it. Each time a user interacts with
the contract, a percentage of the gas fees is automatically allocated to the developer, proportional to
the execution time spent within the contract. This
system encourages ongoing infrastructure improvements while reducing administrative complexity. In
more advanced constructions, the revenue rights
can be tokenized and then traded or split between
multiple developers.

WHAT SETS IT
APART?
On-chain Transparency

EIP-6969 utilizes Ethereum’s blockchain to guarantee transparency in revenue distribution, ensuring developers are compensated
based on actual contract usage.

Standardization

It offers a unified framework for rewarding developers across
Layer 2 projects, promoting sustainable development practices.

Automated Payouts

Gas fee distribution is handled by smart contracts, streamlining
payouts and minimizing administrative overhead, while ensuring
developers are paid promptly.

AUTO PGF

47

TL;DR
PIONNERED BY MAREK OLSZEWSKI,
GLO DOLLAR

AutoPGF (Automated Public Goods Funding) is a set
of mechanisms that fund public goods automatically,
such as through yields generated from protocol or
token interactions.
Coined by Marek Olszewski in 2024, AutoPGF simply means automatic public goods funding. AutoPGF
utilizes revenue from network activities to support
ecosystem development. The idea gained traction
as projects like Glo Dollar (a stablecoin that uses its
yield to fund public goods) or Octant (a group of ETH
stakers that distribute their funding to public goods)
began to appear and grow.

View on Allo.Expert

AutoPGF creates a funding flywheel where protocol
usage directly supports public goods, aiming to address sustainable funding challenges in blockchain
ecosystems. It enables users to indirectly contribute
to ecosystem growth through their regular onchain
activities.

AUTO PGF

48

AUTO PGF

49

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is ideal for blockchain protocols
and decentralized applications (dApps) that want to
contribute to ecosystem growth and sustainability.
It’s particularly suited for protocols with consistent
user activity and revenue generation.

FUNDING STRATEGY
AutoPGF channels a portion of protocol revenue directly to public goods projects. This revenue comes
from normal user activities. The key idea is creating a
feedback loop: as public goods improve the ecosystem, more users engage with the protocol, generating more funding for public goods.

AUTO PGF

50

HOW DOES IT WORK?
AutoPGF generates revenue through fees or yields
as users interact with the protocol (trading, staking,
etc.). Instead of becoming profit, a portion of this
revenue goes into a treasury for ecosystem public
goods funding.
How is this capital then allocated? While this varies,
a common construction is that the community, often
token holders, votes on which projects to fund. This
process happens automatically, creating a link between protocol usage and ecosystem development.
Users support public goods simply by using the protocol, without additional costs. The system aims to
create a sustainable funding cycle: more usage leads
to more funding for public goods, potentially driving
further protocol adoption.

TL;DR
DEVELOPED BY JUSTICE CONDER,
TAMARA HELENIUS, AND GRIFF GREEN
THROUGH GIVETH AND COMMONS STACK
COLLABORATION

Quadratic Accelerator (Q/ACC) functions as a capital
allocation mechanism by combining Quadratic Funding (QF) and Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC).
- QF allows small individual donations to have a large
impact by amplifying the collective contributions.
- A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that
determines the price of a token based on its supply,
typically increasing the price as more tokens are
issued or purchased.

View on Allo.Expert

Q/ACC was developed in 2024 to address challenges in securing chain commitment and fair token
distribution. The combination of QF and ABC creates
token launches with built-in liquidity, passive revenue
streams, and default token utility.

Q U A D R AT I C A C C E L E R AT O R

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
Web3 projects see fair, sustainable token launches
without VC dependence. This strategy is ideal for
teams wanting to avoid high tokenization costs,
focus on development, and prioritize transparent,
community-focused growth with equitable token
distribution.

FUNDING STRATEGY
The Q/ACC funding strategy uses Augmented
Bonding Curves to create initial liquidity and stabilize
token prices from the start. It then leverages Quadratic Funding rounds to emphasize broad participation rather than concentrating funds from a few large
investors.

Q U A D R AT I C A C C E L E R AT O R

58

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) provides
initial liquidity by locking funds into a curve that sets
token prices based on supply, ensuring price stability
in the early stages. This is followed by QF rounds,
where community donations are matched, prioritizing broad participation over total funds raised. This
ensures that resources are broadly distributed to
projects with strong community backing.
In addition to facilitating fair token distribution, the
Q/ACC model generates passive revenue streams
through continuous market interactions. It aligns the
interests of the project and its supporters, encouraging long-term commitment and sustainable growth.
This mechanism is ideal for web3 projects focused
on building equitable, community-driven growth with
a sustainable financial foundation.

TL;DR
PIONEERED BY AUSTIN GRIFFITH

BuidlGuidl Streams provide Ethereum builders with
a funding stream that allows for flexible withdrawals
based on their contributions.
Originating from Austin Griffith’s initiative to support
impactful projects, BuidlGuidl Streams ensures
consistent financial backing for builders creating
products, prototypes, and tutorials in the web3 ecosystem. The mechanism emphasizes trust and flexibility, requiring builders very little to start a receiving
a stream, but to state their reasons for withdrawals,
creating more of a barrier to claiming it.

View on Allo.Expert

calls, where the core team recognizes individuals
making valuable contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. For each selected builder, a smart contract
is deployed that starts fully funded, allowing for immediate access to resources rather than dispensing
funds gradually. Each contract permits a maximum
withdrawal amount over a 30-day period—typically
around 1.5 ETH.
As builders complete their work, they can withdraw
funds from their stream, with the “meter” only running when funds are actually withdrawn.
When withdrawing funds via the website, builders
must provide a reason for their withdrawal, detailing the work they have accomplished. The core
team periodically refills these streams based on
the builders’ contributions and withdrawal patterns.
As long as they continue to actively contribute to
the ecosystem, builders can repeatedly access the
same stream for additional withdrawals. In this way,
contributors are dynamically funded based on their
ongoing contributions.

Investment DAOs function as a funding mechanism
by decentralizing venture capital, allowing community members to collectively make investment decisions.

View on Allo.Expert

They were popularized by Metacartel Ventures,
Seed Club, and Orange DAO, which adopted a community-centric approach. This model democratizes
venture capital by spreading decision-making power
across a larger group and shifting power away from
traditional centralized investors.

INVESTMENT DAOS

72

INVESTMENT DAOS

73

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This model is ideal for groups or individuals seeking
flexible and community-driven funding.
Small investors, who may not meet the capital
requirements of conventional investments, can participate through governance tokens, gaining decision-making power and sharing in profits.
Additionally, communities looking to pool resources
while retaining democratic control over fund allocation can ensure that all participants have a say in
capital decisions.

FUNDING STRATEGY
Building on traditional VC frameworks, investment
DAOs incorporate features of crowdsourcing,
crowdfunding, and cooperative models to support
collective funding through community voting and enhanced investor engagement. These collectives pool
resources and may target investments in venture
capital, real estate, intellectual property, or various
other asset classes.

INVESTMENT DAOS

74

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Investors contribute to a DAO-controlled treasury by
purchasing governance tokens, which grant them
voting rights to influence investment decisions.
Some investment DAOs also generate funds through
mechanisms like staking to ensure ongoing capital
availability for future investments. Funds are allocated based on votes cast by token holders, with each
member’s voting power proportional to the number
of governance tokens they hold. Additionally, some
DAOs match funds to amplify the impact of community contributions.
The disbursement of funds can occur either upfront
as a lump sum or be tied to specific milestones, depending on the project and DAO’s structure. Projects
must submit a proposal detailing their vision, roadmap, and funding needs, which are reviewed and
voted upon. The funding process generally includes
three stages: Proposal Submission - where propsective investments pitch. Voting - where a go/no-go
decision is made. And finally, investment execution
- where tokens are exchanged.
Funding rounds can be either fixed or rolling. DAOs
like Hydra Ventures have fixed funding cycles such
as quarterly or biannual rounds, during which investment decisions are made collectively. Others, like
Seed Club, operate on a rolling basis, making funding
decisions continuously as long as capital is available.

TL;DR
DESIGNED BY OTTODAO

LottoPGF functions as a capital formation mechanism that allows anyone to launch customizable, fully
onchain “Lottos” to fund causes they care about.
These lotteries are secured on Ethereum, featuring
verifiable randomness and unbiased winner selection. By bringing the traditional lottery system onchain, LottoPGF aims to address the transparency,
fairness, and verifiability challenges commonly found
in conventional lotteries.
OttoDAO, the team behind LottoPGF, has already
launched early versions of the protocol. As of
October 2024, LottoPGF has attracted over 16,000
unique addresses who have played more than
40,000 tickets across five different blockchain
networks.

View on Allo.Expert

In the web3 public goods funding space, where most
mechanisms focus on resource allocation, LottoPGF shifts attention to capital formation. It does this
by incentivizing retail donations, reducing reliance
on large sponsors, and enhancing neutrality. This
approach aims to make public goods funding more
accessible, engaging, and community-driven.

LOT TO P G F

LOT TO P G F

81

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is well-suited for communities with
strong commitment and vision, groups wanting to incentivize donations, charities, and emerging nations
like network states or pop-up cities, as it enhances
transparency and community involvement.

FUNDING STRATEGY
LottoPGF allows anyone to create customizable, permissionless lotteries to fund public goods. Powered
by verifiable random functions (VRFs), which generate cryptographic randomness for fairness, lotteries
can be single or recurring, with flexible options for
fund disbursement and prize redistribution.

LOT TO P G F

82

HOW DOES IT WORK?
LottoPGF rounds begin with configuration options
such as the ticket price, token (like an ERC-20), and
determining how funds are split between the prize
pool and the public good. Ticket buyers can choose
to support one or multiple causes. Organizers can
also adjust the odds of winning and customize the
frequency of draws, whether recurring or a single
round. In single-round lotteries, if no winner is found,
the prize pool is evenly distributed among all participants.
The way funds are allocated can vary, from direct
support to creating a matching pool. Depending
on the setup, disbursements are either from direct
support or milestone-based. The entire system is
permissionless, meaning anyone can deploy the
protocol without needing approval.

View on Allo.Expert

Vitalik Buterin proposed them as a conceptual model

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
DAO ICOs are ideal for blockchain projects and
decentralized organizations that need continuous
community involvement and oversight. They are
particularly suited for projects that benefit from increased investor control over fund release, improved
transparency through smart contracts, and fraud
prevention by limiting upfront access to funds and
tying disbursements to project milestones.

FUNDING STRATEGY
A DAO ICO is a hybrid fundraising model that combines elements of ICOs and DAOs. It gives contributors the power to vote on the release of funds after
the fundraising stage.

DAO ICOS

90

HOW DOES IT WORK?
During a contribution period, investors purchase
governance tokens using ETH/DAI. The funds
raised are securely stored in a DAOICO treasury.
After the contribution period, a voting process is
established where investors can decide how much
of the funds are released at each stage of the
project’s development. This control mechanism,
often referred to as the “tap,” allows the amount
of funding to be increased or decreased based on
the project’s progress and performance.
Additionally, if the project fails or underperforms,
investors have the option to vote for a refund,
enabling them to retrieve any remaining funds.

Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) function as a funding
mechanism by allowing private investors to fund
public social programs, with returns dependent on
achieving specific social outcomes.

View on Allo.Expert

SIBs were first introduced by Social Finance Ltd. in
2010. They transfer the risk of program failure from
the public sector to private investors, ensuring that
government payments are only made if the program
successfully achieves its goals. This model supports
collaboration between governments, non-profits, and
investors, aligning financial returns with meaningful
social impact while promoting accountability and
performance-driven outcomes.

issues with a focus on long-term impact without
risking taxpayers’ money. SIBs are particularly
attractive for organizations looking to implement
evidence-based, performance-driven programs that
address complex social challenges.

FUNDING STRATEGY
The SIB funding strategy is based on legal agreements in which investors fund social programs and
are repaid by the government with interest if the
programs meet predetermined success metrics.

S O C I A L I M PA C T B O N D (S I B)

98

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Government agencies, non-profit organizations, or
community leaders identify a pressing social issue,
which could be anything from reducing homelessness to improving educational outcomes for at-risk
youth. Once the need is identified, experts design a
program to address the issue(s).
After the program is designed, private investors step
in to provide the necessary funding. Once funding
is secured, experienced non-profit organizations are
brought in to provide services and support to the
target population as outlined in the program design.
Post-execution, an independent third-party evaluator
is brought in to assess the program’s performance.
This evaluator collects and analyzes data throughout the program’s duration to measure its progress
against the predetermined success metrics.
If the evaluation shows that the program has
achieved its goals, the government fulfills its commitment to repay the investors. This repayment
includes the initial investment plus an agreed-upon
return, which serves as a reward for the investors’
risk-taking and an incentive for future investments
in social programs. If the program fails to meet its
predetermined success metrics, investors may lose
part or all of their initial investment.

TL;DR
DESIGNED BY ARNOLD HARBERGER
POPULARIZED BY GLEN WEYL AND ERIC
POSNER

Harberger Taxes function as a funding mechanism
by taxing assets based on self-assessed values,
encouraging efficient use and benefiting societal
welfare.

View on Allo.Expert

Harberger Taxes, introduced by economist Arnold
Harberger in the 1960s, are typically applied to land
and real estate but can also be used for intellectual
property and digital assets, including NFT marketplaces. The idea has gained traction through the
works of economists Glen Weyl and Eric Posner.

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

104

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

105

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This funding strategy is beneficial for any community aiming to enhance resource allocation, curb
monopolies, and generate revenue for public goods.
Communities can utilize these taxes to fund operations, expand their treasuries, or redistribute funds
among members. This mechanism can also support
sustainable resource use while ensuring that value
creation is effectively rewarded without the need for
traditional taxation.

FUNDING STRATEGY
Harberger Taxes create a new kind of “partial common ownership” somewhere between private and
common ownership. The goal is to reduce inefficiencies from hoarding and speculative behavior. Under
this system, assets remain available for sale at the
owner’s declared value, creating a balance between
ownership desire and tax obligations.

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

106

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Harberger Taxes can be implemented onchain,
where smart contracts handle the key processes:
setting the sale price, collecting taxes, managing
continuous market interactions, and reassessing
ownership. The processes in this mechanism are
highly customizable. To begin, owners must self-assess the value of their assets, such as land, intellectual property, or other valuable resources, and be
willing to sell at that declared price. Then, a set percentage of this self-assessed value is taxed regularly,
with the rate and frequency predefined.
Setting the right tax rate is crucial. If the rate is too
high, it may discourage ownership, while a rate that’s
too low might not motivate efficient resource use.
There are also modified versions of Harberger Taxes
aimed at reducing owner uncertainty. One option is a
transition period that lets owners retain possession
after a sale, allowing them to reclaim the asset by
paying a percentage of the buyer’s declared value.
Another approach ties the owner’s tax rate to the
highest bid, giving them the choice to sell when they
want as long as taxes are paid. These adjustments
ensure owners, not buyers, control the sale.

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

107

Asset Valuation
The owner publicly declares the value of their asset,
which determines their tax liability.

Tax Payment
The owner pays a regular tax based on the declared value,
typically a percentage of it.

Always for Sale
The asset is always available for purchase at the declared
price. If someone pays that price, they can immediately
buy the asset.

Transfer of Ownership
Once purchased, the new owner declares a new value
and begins paying taxes, while the asset remains available
for sale under the same rules.

HARBERGER TAXES

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

108

WHAT SETS IT
APART?

Continuous Market
Interaction

Harberger Taxes maintain a constant market environment where
assets are always for sale. This keeps resources circulating,
ensuring they end up with those who value them most and are
willing to pay for them.

Taxation as an Incentive
for Efficiency

Owners are regularly taxed based on their self-declared asset
value, pushing them to assess the true worth of their property
accurately. If they overvalue it, they pay higher taxes, which encourages more efficient and productive use of the resource.

Dynamic Asset
Allocation

The constant possibility of sale and the tax on ownership can curb
monopolies and lead to a more equitable distribution of assets.

H A R B E R G E R TA X E S

109

EXAMPLE
GeoWeb
GeoWeb is an open geospatial information network
that fosters augmented, shared reality through the
use of digital land registry smart contracts and partial common ownership. In this system, landholders
must publicly declare a sale price for each of their
land parcels using ETHx, a wrapped version of ETH
that facilitates streaming payments. Landholders
are required to pay a license fee to the network to
maintain their parcel license. This fee is set at 10%
of their declared sale price annually. They must also
authorize a payment stream and keep ETHx in their
wallet. Any market participant has the ability to
initiate the transfer of a parcel by paying the current
landholder their declared sale price.

FORMALIZED BY EUGEN VON
BÖHM-BAWERK

Roundabout production is when get more of something by first producing something else - For example, youd cut down more trees if you produce axes
beforehand.
Roundabout production functions as a funding
mechanism by investing in intermediate stages or
foundational technologies to enhance productivity
and support long-term profitability.

View on Allo.Expert

The concept of ‘roundabout production’ traces
back to the Austrian School of Economics, particularly through the works of Carl Menger, Eugen
von Böhm-Bawerk, and later, Ludwig von Mises
and Friedrich Hayek. It was formally introduced in
Böhm-Bawerk’s 1891 book “The Positive Theory of

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is best suited for projects or DAOs
focused on building core blockchain infrastructure or
scalable governance systems. It’s ideal for organizations willing to make long-term investments in
research and development rather than looking for
immediate returns.

FUNDING STRATEGY
The roundabout production funding strategy
involves investing in projects with complex, high-resource needs (e.g., Ethereum Layer 2 solutions,
cross-chain bridges, decentralized storage). It
emphasizes the core principle that a more strategic,
long-term path ultimately optimizes processes and
maximizes output over time, aligning well with the
infrastructure needs in web3.

RO UNDABO UT PRO D U CTI O N

114

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The roundabout production process generally
begins identifying long-term objectives (eg increase
adoption of our product). Then the community sets
out to find high leverage projects to meet these
objectives.
Fund allocation for roundabout production is direct
and disbursement varies. Often, funds are provided on a milestone basis to ensure projects receive
funds after achieving specific benchmarks. An
additional option is for some funds to be distributed
while others are locked in staking mechanisms to
encourage long-term commitment.
In roundabout production, funding is first allocated
to the identification, creation, and implementation
of anything needed to improve the projects objectives. Next, these ideas are applied to more tangible
outputs that can receive funding.
One example of roundabout production looks like in
web3 is Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS)
in Ethereum 2.0. While this transition was lengthy
and complex, it was crucial for enhancing scalability,
energy efficiency, and security—foundational elements for the future growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other
decentralized applications.

TL;DR
DESIGNED BY SAFE (FORMERLY GNOSIS)

The Gnosis multi-signature wallet, now known as
Safe, originated from Gnosis, a blockchain company
founded in 2015 by Martin Köppelmann and Stefan
George. Initially focused on prediction markets, Gnosis developed the Gnosis Safe in 2017 to address the
need for secure digital asset management.
The Gnosis Safe started as a multi-signature wallet,
requiring multiple approvals for transactions, which
made it ideal for decentralized organizations (DAOs)
and teams. Its security features and flexibility quickly
made it a standard tool across the Ethereum network, widely adopted by DAOs, DeFi projects, and
institutional investors.

View on Allo.Expert

In 2022, recognizing the Safe’s broader potential,
Gnosis spun it off as an independent entity, rebranding it as simply “Safe”. Today, Safe supports over
7 million smart accounts, secures more than $100
billion in assets, and continues to evolve as a crucial
infrastructure for decentralized asset management
and governance in the crypto ecosystem.

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This governance mechanism effectively supports
DAOs in overseeing treasuries, funding proposals,
and investment decisions. Enterprises can use Safe
to manage corporate digital assets among various
stakeholders, while public goods projects can adopt
this tool for transparent and accountable fund allocation.

STRATEGY
By default, Safe Wallet operates using a multi-signature mechanism where funds are held in a smart
contract, and any transaction requires a predefined
number of signatures to proceed. Members submit proposals for transactions or fund allocations,
and each signer must approve before the action is
executed.
Alongside the multisig entrypoint, Safe is also a
modular and extensible account standard that can
be adopted to many different use-cases, allowing
users to evolve their account over time to accommodate changing needs.

G N O S I S ’ M U LT I - S I G N A T U R E W A L L E T S

124

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Safe Wallet operates as a secure, multi-signature
asset management tool built on Safe Smart Accounts. Users start by deploying a multi-signature
smart contract on a blockchain like Ethereum. They
then configure the wallet by setting a threshold of
required signers for transaction approvals, ensuring
no single user can act unilaterally.
Once configured, users or organizations deposit
funds into the Safe Wallet. When a transaction
needs to occur, a member submits a proposal, which
is then visible to all designated signers. Each signer
reviews the transaction, and if they approve, they
provide their digital signature. Only when the predefined number of signatures is collected does the
smart contract execute the transaction.
Safe Wallet also offers features like gasless transactions, where relayers cover gas fees, and transaction
batching, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into one for efficiency. All actions are recorded
onchain, providing full transparency and accountability for secure fund management.

DEVELOPED BY MARK FROHNMAYER AND
THE EQUAL VOTE COALITION

STAR Voting functions as a governance mechanism
by reflecting voter preferences through a scoring
and runoff process, ensuring fair and representative
decision-making.

View on Allo.Expert

Created in 2014 by Mark Frohnmayer, STAR Voting
aims to enhance electoral systems. It can be integrated into DAOs for decision-making and funding
distribution. This helps ensure all voter preferences
are accounted for in both phases.

S TA R V O T I N G

S TA R V O T I N G

131

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This governance mechanism is ideal for DAOs managing elections with multiple candidates or proposals. It minimizes vote-splitting and increases voter
satisfaction through nuanced preference expression,
often resulting in broadly supported winners. It is
also helpful for communities looking to enhance trust
and participation.

STRATEGY
STAR Voting is a system where voters score each
candidate on a scale from 0 to 5 stars. The two
highest-scoring candidates proceed to an automatic
runoff, in which the candidate preferred by more
voters wins. It is simple, expressive, and designed to
reflect the will of the majority without the complications of Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV).

S TA R V O T I N G

132

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Under the STAR system, voters give their favorite
candidate five stars and can leave their least favorite
blank or assign zero stars. They can rate the remaining candidates between 1 and 4 stars according
to their preference and can give equal ratings to
multiple candidates.
Next, the counting process begins and follows the
Score Then Automatic Runoff (STAR) method. In this
phase, the two highest-scoring candidates move
on as finalists. Each voter’s ballot then reflects their
preferences, with their vote automatically assigned
to their preferred finalist. The finalist with the most
votes is ultimately declared the winner.

POPULARIZED BY FAIRVOTE AND
ELECTORAL REFORM ADVOCACY GROUPS

Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) functions as a governance mechanism by ensuring elected candidates
reflect majority preferences, allowing voters to rank
their choices for more representative outcomes.

View on Allo.Expert

Originating in the 1850s as a proportional representation system, RCV was adapted for single-winner
elections by William Ware in the 1870s. A more contemporary movement for RCV emerged in the early
2000s, addressing the limitations of plurality voting,
with support from grassroots initiatives and organizations like FairVote, a nonpartisan group focused on
voting reforms that aim to enhance electoral fairness
and reduce polarization.

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This governance mechanism is ideal for elections,
organizational decision-making, and competitive contexts like funding allocation in DAOs. It enhances fair
representation and community engagement, making
it suitable for any entity seeking to foster trust and
encourage active participation in governance.

STRATEGY
RCV allows voters to rank candidates by preference
and can also function as a funding mechanism,
enabling community members to rank proposals for
funding allocation. This approach is influenced by
traditional runoff elections, which seek a more efficient winner-determination process without separate
runoffs; social choice theory, which addresses the
fair aggregation of collective preferences; and voter
behavior research, which highlights the strategic
voting tendencies in plurality systems and the demand for more expressive voting options.

RANKED CHO I CE VOTIN G

140

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The RCV process begins with voters ranking candidates or proposals in order of preference on their
ballots.
Here is a RCV Ballot:

Each column represents a different ranking position,
while the rows correspond to specific candidates
or options. Voters must make only one choice per
column and cannot skip columns.
Once the ballots are cast, the first-choice votes for
each candidate are counted. If a candidate receives
more than half of the votes, they win the election.
However, if no candidate secures a majority of
first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest
votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed
based on voters’ next preferences until a candidate
achieves a majority. This elimination and redistribution process continues until a candidate receives a
majority of the votes and is declared the winner.

145

TL;DR
DESIGNED BY DANDELION MANE

SourceCred functions as a governance mechanism
by assessing individual contributions and distributing rewards based on the effort, complexity, and
impact of those contributions.

View on Allo.Expert

It was conceptualized in 2017 and introduced in
August of 2019 during an initiative called the CredSperiment, which aimed to provide a trial run of the
technology to see if it could provide transparent
and relational tracking of contributions based on
intersubjective quality rather than quantity. Today,
SourceCred is a series of plugins to measure contributions and allocate rewards.

SOURCECRED

146

SOURCECRED

147

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is ideal for DAOs, community
managers, and project managers seeking to directly
reward contributions based on their impact on the
underlying project. It’s additionally beneficial for
those concerned with Sybil resistance, as it employs
multiple strategies focused on transparency and
easy community oversight.

STRATEGY
The SourceCred strategy involves distributing Grain,
a tradeable community token, to contributors based
on the number of non-transferrable Cred tokens their
contributions have earned. This is done using a neutral framework that assigns scores and distributes
tokens accordingly.

SOURCECRED

148

HOW DOES IT WORK?
SourceCred uses an algorithm to determine the value a contributor adds to a project. This algorithm includes customizable plugins for community-specific
moderation, and it operates transparently on publicly
accessible data without storing community information. When a contribution is made, SourceCred
attests to it and assigns an amount of “cred” based
on its value to the project. This cred flows from the
contribution to all the people and other contributions
that supported it.
In the SourceCred mechanism, a project is represented as a node graph of contributions and people. The nodes are connected to allow Cred flow
between them based on the support relationships
between different contributions. The more connections a contribution has to other contributions in
the project, the more opportunities it has to receive
Cred. This structure provides a visual and measurable representation, known as the Cred Score,
showing which contributions are foundational and
which support future work within the project.
The SourceCred algorithm also uses “weights,” a
set of rules that determine how much Cred different
types of contributions are worth. Each community
can decide the weights for its Cred distribution,
allowing it to define what it values most and which
actions reflect those values.
Since Cred is non-transferable, it cannot be bought
or sold, preserving its integrity as a measure of contribution. However, Grain, a community currency tied
directly to one’s Cred, can be exchanged. Grain is
minted and distributed to contributors based on the
Cred they have earned, allowing it to be transferred
both within and outside the project.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY THE GOLEM FOUNDATION

Octant functions as a governance mechanism by allowing token holders to lock tokens, gain governance
rights, and influence funding decisions in decentralized systems.
Launched on the Ethereum mainnet on August 8,
2023, it is best known as a platform for participatory public goods funding, developed by the Golem
Foundation and created to experiment with decentralized governance and sustainable PGF models.
Leveraging 100,000 ETH staked, Octant funds
recurring rounds where GLM holders lock tokens to
earn rewards and governance rights while donations
are boosted by matched funding.

O C TA N T G L M L O C K I N G M E C H A N I S M

155

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This type of mechanism is best suited for those who
aim to attract long-term participation from those
committed to the growth of their ecosystem. It
engages public goods supporters who favor direct
project funding, with subtle gamification offering the
chance for substantial rewards without any risk to
their original contributions.

STRATEGY
Octant’s operates through 90-day Epochs. The
Golem Foundation stakes 100,000 ETH and allocates part of the staking returns to fund Octant,
distributing the funds between User Rewards and
Matched Rewards. Users lock GLM to partake in
these rewards, which are calculated based on a
time-weighted average.

O C TA N T G L M L O C K I N G M E C H A N I S M

156

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Users are required to lock a minimum of 100 GLM
tokens into a smart contract for a 90-day epoch. The
more GLM that is locked, and the longer it remains
locked, the greater the rewards and voting power
assigned to the participant. This design incentivizes
sustained engagement while allowing users to maintain full control of their assets.
The mechanism is non-custodial, meaning users retain complete control over their GLM tokens and can
unlock them at any time. However, optimal participation and maximum rewards are achieved by maintaining the lock for the full duration of the epoch.
The reward structure operates on a time-weighted
average, ensuring that extended and substantial
locks yield proportionally higher returns.
Voting power in governance decisions is directly
proportional to the amount of GLM locked.
From Epoch Two onward, Octant has implemented
a “minimal value strategy,” whereby voting power is
determined by the smallest amount of GLM held in
the lock during the epoch. This approach promotes
consistency in locking behavior, as any reduction
in the locked amount diminishes the participant’s
influence and rewards.
When an epoch ends, participants enter an allocation window during which they can choose to
either claim their rewards or donate them to public
goods projects. Donations are enhanced through a
matched rewards pool, increasing their impact. This
model not only rewards individual engagement but
also reinforces community-driven funding, aligning
participant incentives with broader public goods
support.

WHAT SETS IT
APART?

Non-Custodial
Design

Unlike many staking models that pool assets or require custodianship, Octant’s mechanism ensures that users maintain full control
of their GLM tokens at all times and allows flexibility in unlocking
funds without penalties.

Time-Weighted
Rewards

While many mechanisms reward solely based on the total amount
staked, Octant uses time-weighted averages to calculate rewards,
which encourages longer-term engagement.

Minimal Value
Strategy

Many web3 platforms incentivize short-term, large stakes. In contrast, Octant calculates voting power based on the minimum GLM
locked (starting from epoch 2), encouraging consistent participation and deterring short-term locking and unlocking strategies.

Interactive Allocation
Process

By incorporating an allocation window, Octant introduces gamification, enabling users to adjust their funding strategies according
to real-time community behavior. Few web3 mechanisms integrate
this level of interactivity and flexibility in governance, making
Octant’s process both participatory and responsive.

Bonding Curves act as a funding and pricing mechanism by using smart contracts to automatically

View on Allo.Expert

Key contributors include Slava Balasanov (Bancor),
Simon de la Rouviere, and Abraham Othman, who
helped popularize the concept within decentralized
finance (DeFi). Bonding Curves were first effectively
implemented in Ethereum projects, enabling decentralized markets without centralized exchanges.

BO ND IN G CURVES

BO ND IN G CURVES

163

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
Bonding Curves will benefit projects seeking to solve
liquidity challenges and implement a more dynamic
token economy. They are ideal for teams looking to
raise continuous funding without relying on centralized exchanges and investors who want a transparent and predictable mechanism for token acquisition
and liquidation. Bonding Curves are also increasingly
integrated into DeFi protocols and experimented
with for non-financial use cases, offering versatile
applications beyond simple token issuance.

STRATEGY
Bonding Curves allow projects to sell tokens at
prices that increase as more tokens are minted, incentivizing early adoption. Conversely, tokens can be
sold back to the contract at prices determined by the
same curve, providing liquidity for token holders.

BO ND IN G CURVES

164

HOW DOES IT WORK?
A project begins by deploying a smart contract with
a predefined bonding curve formula, setting initial
parameters such as the starting price and reserve
ratio.
When users purchase tokens, they send funds (e.g.,
ETH) to the contract, which calculates the number
of tokens to mint based on the current supply and
curve formula. These newly minted tokens are sent
to the user, while the received funds are added to
the reserve pool. When users wish to sell tokens,
they send them back to the contract, which calculates the amount of reserve currency to return using
the bonding curve. The tokens are then burned, and
the user receives the corresponding amount from
the reserve pool.
This process continues indefinitely, with the price
adjusting automatically as tokens are minted or
burned. Key features include automated market-making, built-in incentives for early adopters, and a
transparent, predictable pricing system. Additionally,
customizable curve shapes allow projects to tailor
the model to their specific needs.

TL;DR
INVENTED BY JUICEBOX

Revnets function as a governance mechanism by
using an onchain cap table to enable transparent,
decentralized participation and revenue generation
without governance or management overhead.

View on Allo.Expert

Invented by Jango and other Juicebox contributors
(Robert Leonhard, JohnnyD, Wraith, Nowonder),
revnets are built on the Juicebox v4 protocol—a
crypto fundraising and DAO management platform.
Structured as a Delaware-based LLC that invests in
$REV tokens, this open-source mechanism focuses
on providing a transparent and cost-efficient funding
model that enables broad participation and revenue
generation that can be used to address monetization, competitive advantage, and dependency
dilemmas.

REVNETS

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is a good fit for leaders, creators,
and investors looking to bootstrap and sustain
projects without the burdens of active oversight. According to Jango, it serves as a hands-free, all-in-one
growth engine which resolves the tension between
open source productivity and private value capture.

STRATEGY
Revnets currently operate on Ethereum mainnet,
Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, offering a clear model
for productive wealth creation and distribution within decentralized ecosystems. They act like a “digital
vending machine” that accepts funds and issues
unique tokens ($TOKENs). To access revnet funds,
participants must return their $TOKENs, which
incentivizes long-term engagement and creates a
self-sustaining ecosystem. Since the cash-out value
of each $TOKEN can never decrease, they also
support loans.

REVNETS

172

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Revnets enforce three main rules that are preset and
can change over time. First, there is always a set
price at which the revnet issues new $TOKENs. If an
Automated Market Maker (AMM) offers a better rate
than the issuance price, incoming funds are redirected to the AMM. This rate can also be adjusted
over time. The second rule concerns the $TOKEN
split, allowing a percentage of purchased tokens to
be allocated to a privileged account, with the split
percentage customizable at set intervals. The final
rule allows $TOKENs to be returned to the revnet
for a share of its revenue, with a tax that increases
the value of future cash-outs and rewards long-term
holders.
Additionally, users can leverage $TOKENs as collateral to access loans, which can be repaid over time
to regain the tokens. If the loan is not repaid, the
collateral is liquidated by the provider. Repayment
can last up to 10 years, and borrowers can choose
different options, such as paying over time, pre-paying at half the cost, or a combination. Each loan from
revnets incurs a 2.5% $NANA fee and a 0.5% $REV
fee, which are used to fund the revnets issuance or
buyback of $TOKENs.

REVNETS

173

A revnet can be paid in ETH, and/or other tokens (shown below as dollar bills).

2

The payments from (1) generate its own tokens at a given price, say 1 ETH buys 1,000 $TOKEN or NFT artifact (shown as

4

A revnet can have a split in place that automatically sends a percentage of these new $TOKENs to a set of
pre-established entities, say 20% split so that 100 $TOKEN goes to each of two builders and 80% goes to the
payer of the 1 ETH.
The ETH stay in the vending machine.

In order to get the 1 ETH back out, a $TOKEN holder has to cash out, which incurs a tax.

This means if one of the builders wanted to cash out their 100 $TOKENs right away, they would get less than the
proportional 0.1 ETH if a tax was in place, leaving revenue on the table for those who cash out later.

TL;DR

Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs)
function as a cooperative model by enabling individuals to pool capital collectively.

View on Allo.Expert

Emerging around 200 B.C. in China, ROSCAs are
informal financial systems in which individuals agree
to cooperatively pool capital. These systems operate outside formal banking and adapt to different
cultural contexts. They provide participants a way to
access lump sums for significant expenses, such as
weddings, medical bills, or business investments.

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is best for tight-knit, trust-based
groups with shared goals. It provides a simple,
low-barrier financial solution for communities. While
it’s often used by resource-constrained groups
without access to formal financial services, it also
works well for inclusive communities focused on fair
resource distribution.

STRATEGY
ROSCAs are comparable to DAO treasuries, but
participants are guaranteed a return. While not
inherently onchain, they can be transitioned using
smart contracts and enhancing transparency with all
activities recorded on the blockchain. This system
enables individuals to bypass traditional credit or
banking institutions and operates with an interest-free structure.

R O TAT I N G S AV I N G S A N D C R E D I T A S S O C I AT I O N S ( R O S C A )

182

HOW DOES IT WORK?
ROSCAs are contingent on all participants agreeing
to contribute a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, such as weekly or monthly. The total amount
is given to one member at a time, and the order of
distribution can be predetermined, randomly selected, or decided by need or bidding.
Members take turns receiving the pot, ensuring each
person benefits once during the cycle. After everyone has received the pot, the group starts a new
cycle, adjusting the terms as needed. While adapted
differently across regions, the core principles remain
consistent, with variations in meeting frequency,
contribution amounts, and fund distribution rules.

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is well-suited for digital artists,
NFT enthusiasts, and communities interested in
decentralized art creation, curation, and ownership.
This methodology is for revenue sharing and artist
collaboration.

STRATEGY
BasePaint operates through daily open-edition NFT
sales, with the profits distributed among contributors based on the number of pixels they paint.
Collectors buy the art NFT, and artists receive 90%
of the profits, while 10% goes to the protocol.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Artists mint a brush to contribute to a shared canvas.
The community creates artwork collaboratively over
24 hours. When time is up, the canvas locks. Open
edition NFTs of the completed artwork are then
minted. Profits from the open-edition sale are distributed among the contributing artists based on the
number of pixels painted relative to the total number
of pixels contributed.

Onchain
Collaborative Art

BasePaint allows multiple artists to contribute to a single digital
canvas, resulting in a collaborative artwork that is then minted as
an NFT. This collective approach to digital art creation is distinctive in the NFT space.

Transparent Onchain
Revenue Sharing

The platform uses smart contracts to distribute 90% of the profits
from NFT sales directly to the contributing artists based on their
pixel contributions. This transparent and fair revenue-sharing
model is built directly into the blockchain mechanism.

Quadratic Voting for
Theme Selection

BasePaint employs Quadratic Voting to allow the community to
select daily themes and color palettes. This democratic approach
to decision-making ensures that the community determines
creative direction in a way that prevents domination by a few large
stakeholders.

Artwork is stored
Onchain and is CC0

Anyone can recreate any BasePaint canvas from the onchain
data and use the artwork in whatever way they see fit. Multiple
derivative art projects have been made, passing revenue back to
the original artists.

TL;DR

Breadchain functions as a cooperative model by
advancing post-capitalist values through a decentralized funding approach that fosters solidarity and
equitable resource distribution.

View on Allo.Expert

Breadchain emerged as a decentralized cooperative
with an onchain crowdstaking application that allows
users to stake DAI in exchange for BREAD tokens,
representing their contribution to the cooperative.
The yield generated from staking is distributed democratically through a voting process every 30 days.
This mechanism enhances transparency, empowers
members, and directs resources toward projects that
align with cooperative principles and mutual support.

B R E A D C H A I N - O N C H A I N C R O W D S TA K I N G M E C H A N I S M

197

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
Breadchain is perfect for individuals and communities seeking to build decentralized collectives that
emphasize shared, mutual benefits over profit-driven
objectives. Web3 communities exploring innovative
economic models that focus on community well-being and transparent governance will find Breadchain
a powerful tool. It encourages collaboration between
projects and demonstrates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to foster social good beyond
mere financial speculation, driving collective action
and equitable resource distribution within a cooperative framework. It can also serve as an alternative
to traditional investment options like venture capital,
as it offers a form of bootstrapping to support their
growth.

STRATEGY
The strategy of Breadchain’s cooperative model
revolves around pooling resources from its members
through the Crowdstaking Protocol, where participants stake xDAI in exchange for BREAD tokens.

B R E A D C H A I N - O N C H A I N C R O W D S TA K I N G M E C H A N I S M

198

HOW DOES IT WORK?
In the Breadchain crowdstaking model, users participate by converting xDai into BREAD tokens, which
serve as their stake in the cooperative. To get started, users connect their wallets to the Breadchain
Crowdstaking App and convert xDai into BREAD
tokens at a 1:1 ratio. The staked xDai generates yield,
which is pooled to fund cooperative projects. Every
30 days, members use their BREAD tokens to vote
on how this generated yield is allocated to different
community-endorsed projects, ensuring democratic
decision-making.
Participants have flexibility as they can “burn” their
BREAD tokens at any time to reclaim their original
xDai investment. This process maintains engagement while allowing members to exit when needed,
making it a flexible and community-driven approach
to decentralized funding.

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This type of mechanism is ideal for creators in the
fields of art, science, technology, and culture who
aim to keep their communities fully involved in
funding decisions. It encourages projects to prioritize
their fanbase, often resulting in community growth.
This approach attracts mission-driven brands and
sponsors interested in contributing matching funds,
as well as supporters ready to invest in their favorite
projects through collectible purchases.

FUNDING STRATEGY
Artizen’s funding strategy relies on projects selling cultural artifacts. By selling digital artifacts as
NFTs, Artizen unlocks additional match funds, giving
creators and supporters a stake in each project’s
success. Sponsors pool and match the funds based
on artifact sales, using a logarithmic formula to distribute match funding fairly.

A R T I Z E N : A R T I FA C T S

208

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Artizen established curation guidelines that each
project must meet for eligibility. Only creators with a
project that meet these and qualify for at least one
of their sponsors can submit to the Artizen Fund.
Creators first submit their projects to the Artizen
Fund, where the community votes on all entries. The
Artizen community then votes on the projects submitted, and the top 30% are curated to compete in
the season for match funding and the Artizen prize.
Artizen community members gain voting power by
executing net positive actions on the platform, such
as owning an artifact, sponsoring match funds, submitting projects, etc.
Curated projects compete by selling their artifacts,
usually for 0.01 ETH or US$25. For each artifact sold,
10% goes to the community treasury to maintain the
platform, and 90% goes to the project’s creator.
The more artifacts a project sells, the more match
funding it unlocks. The project that sells the most
artifacts in a Season wins a cash prize equal to 10%
of the total pooled matching funds. At the end of the
season, matching funds are distributed to qualified
projects using a logarithmic match funding formula
to ensure fair distribution.

Pleasr DAO’s time-locked content release is a use
case that illustrates an innovative model that exemplifies the potential of decentralized ownership and
engagement in reshaping how valuable physical and
digital art is distributed.

View on Allo.Expert

Created by Wu-Tang Clan in 2014 as a protest
against the devaluation of music, the album “Once
Upon a Time in Shaolin” was sold to Martin Shkreli
in 2015 for $2 million. After being seized by the U.S.
government, PleasrDAO acquired the album in 2021
for $4 million. They then developed the time-locked
release mechanism to allow participants to accelerate the album’s release through $1 purchases, each
reducing the timeline.

214

TI M E-LO C K ED C O NTENT R ELE AS E: P LE AS R

215

WHO SHOULD USE IT?
This mechanism is ideal for DAOs, artists, and organizations seeking decentralized ownership and community engagement for rare assets. It suits projects
looking to democratize access to exclusive content
while maintaining its rarity. The approach allows
even small participants to influence the release of
valuable cultural works, making it particularly useful
for projects with devoted fan bases or communities.

RELEASE STRATEGY
The Time-Locked Content Release uses token
purchases to accelerate the album’s release date.
Engagement is driven by a points system where
users earn Wu Points via quests or token purchases (1 point per 0.01 ETH). These points determine
a user’s Wu Rank on the leaderboard. Top-ranked
participants gain increased voting power in PleasrDAO proposals. This approach balances accessibility
and exclusivity, allowing broad participation while
maintaining the album’s scarcity.

TI M E-LO C K ED C O NTENT R ELE AS E: P LE AS R

216

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Time-Locked Content Release mechanism
begins with the album locked for an extended
period of 88 years from its original sale date in
2015, setting the initial release for 2103. Fans can
purchase encrypted digital copies for $1 each, with
each purchase shortening the release timeline by 88
seconds. Buyers receive tradable $ALBUM tokens
representing their digital copies. Tokens can be acquired through direct purchases, gameplay rewards,
or community contributions.
To boost participation, the developers included additional engagement layers in the system. Participants
can mint commemorative items and earn points (Wu
Scores) based on their contributions. Top contributors receive extra benefits, such as private event
access. The initial release timeline was backfilled
to account for the time that has passed since the
asset’s original sale in 2015.
As community involvement increases, the release
timeline shortens. When the timeline finally reaches
zero, the content is released to all token holders,
completing the decentralized unlocking process.
This creates a dynamic where the community’s
actions directly reflect the perceived value of the
music, transforming a passive waiting period into an
active, community-driven experience.

standardized. Funding is then allocated based on the
project rankings according to their meassurement of
impact metrics.
To choose which impact metrics to fund, badgeholders (participants with voting power) are given the
choice of which impact metrics they want to reward.
They can preview which projects would receive
funding for each impact metric. Then when their
decision is made, they submit their ballots.
At the end of the round, ballots are then tallied,
and funds are distributed according to the ballots
preferences.

CONCLUSION
Throughout this book, we’ve explored innovative
funding models designed to create a more transparent, democratic, and efficient system for capital
allocation. These models, already making a significant impact within decentralized ecosystems like
Gitcoin and Ethereum, demonstrate the potential
of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to solve traditional
inefficiencies in funding public goods and collective
action initiatives.
We stand at the frontier of what’s possible. We have
a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the
way resources are distributed across industries and
communities. Hopefully this book serves to stimulate progress, both in the minds of its readers and
the ecosystem as a whole.

REFLECTION ON KEY
CONCEPTS
At the heart of this exploration is the recognition
that onchain capital allocation can overcome the
entrenched limitations of traditional systems, including gatekeeping, rivalrous decision-making, and
opaque governance structures. Mechanisms like
Artizen Artifacts combat biased, bureaucratic, and
inefficient funding systems for digital goods creators
with their transparent, community-driven approach.
At the same time, onchain social funding tools such
as DEGEN utilize social media’s built-in attention
to enhance support and engagement, showcasing
the versatility of decentralized strategies in tackling
various collective challenges—from environmental
sustainability to technological progress.

C O N C LU S I O N

243

FUTURE OUTLOOK
As onchain capital allocation mechanisms continue
to evolve, their applications will likely extend beyond
blockchain. The rise of Decentralized Autonomous
Organizations (DAOs) and token-based ecosystems
offers exciting opportunities to disrupt conventional
industries such as real estate, scientific research,
and even government services. The challenge will
be scaling these models to accommodate diverse
sectors while maintaining their core principles of
transparency and inclusion. In particular, challenges
like ensuring robust governance, preventing collusion, and adapting to new regulatory frameworks
must be addressed to sustain long-term growth.

VISION FOR THE FUTURE
Looking ahead, onchain capital allocation can
become a powerful tool for addressing large-scale
challenges like climate change, poverty, and wealth
inequality. These models enable communities to
allocate resources according to their unique needs
and values, creating a world where funding decisions
are no longer dictated by centralized institutions but
by collective wisdom and real-time feedback loops.
The future holds the promise of a decentralized,
pluralistic ecosystem where resources are distributed efficiently, fairly, and in alignment with the public
good.
In sum, onchain capital allocation is not just a novel
idea but a pathway toward progress - locally and
globally. As we continue to build and refine these
systems, we have the opportunity to create a future
where capital flows freely to the causes that matter

FUNDING MECHANISMS
AutoPGF (Automated
Public Goods Funding)

AutoPGF (Automated Public Goods Funding) is a mechanism that
funds public goods through yields generated from protocol or
token interactions.

Quadratic Accelerator
(Q/ACC)

Q/ACC combines Augmented Bonding Curves for liquidity with
Quadratic Funding rounds to match community donations, driving
long-term engagement by aligning incentives between protocol,
project, and community.

Investment DAOs

Expanding on traditional venture capital, Investment DAOs pool
funds and make collective investment choices, with governance
rights proportional to staked tokens and profits distributed based
on time-weighted participation.

Social Impact Bonds
(SIBs)

Private investors fund social programs, with government repayment based on meeting success metrics. If these targets are hit,
investors get their capital back plus a return, calculated using
time-weighted performance to incentivize long-term impact.

Roundabout Production

This mechanism focuses on long-term, strategic project invest´with incremental resource allocation. Rewards are distributed based on resource commitment duration and project success,
encouraging sustained support for complex initiatives.

Participatory Budgeting

Participatory Budgeting is a democratic process where community members decide how to allocate a portion of public or
organizational funds.

Bounties

Rewards offered for completing specific tasks, with payouts
structured to incentivize timely and effective contributions. Bounties are calculated based on task complexity and solution value,
driving targeted problem-solving and innovation.

Harberger Taxes

A property ownership model where owners self-assess their
asset’s value, pay taxes on that value, and must sell to any buyer

G LO S SA RY

247

offering that price. This mechanism aims to balance efficient
resource allocation with fair taxation and use.

Block Rewards Fundings

Block rewards are incentives given to miners or validators for
successfully adding a new block to the blockchain. These rewards
usually come in the form of newly created cryptocurrency and
transaction fees, encouraging participants to secure and maintain
the network.

Impact-Based Metrics:
Optimism RPGF

Optimism RPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) is an
impact-based funding model that rewards projects based on
their proven impact, rather than upfront promises, incentivizing
impactful contributions to the ecosystem.

LottoPGF

LottoPGF is an onchain capital formation mechanism that lets
anyone create customizable “Lottos” to fund causes. Secured
on Ethereum, it ensures transparency, fairness, and verifiable
randomness, addressing the issues of traditional lotteries.

DAO ICOs

DAO ICOs are token sales conducted by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to raise funds for projects. These
sales allow communities to directly participate in the funding and
governance of the project through token ownership.

EIP 6969

EIP-6969 introduces a smart contract-based revenue-sharing
mechanism, allowing developers to receive a portion of gas fees
generated through interactions with their contracts.

Octant GLM Locking
Mechanism

Participants lock GLM tokens for 90-day funding epochs, gaining
governance rights and rewards. Rewards are calculated using
time-weighted metrics based on locking duration, with donations
boosted by matched funding to incentivize long-term support.

STAR Voting

Voters rank candidates or options, with the two top-ranked choices entering a runoff. Votes are redistributed based on preferences, ensuring outcomes reflect long-term community consensus
while minimizing strategic voting manipulation.

Sourcecred

Sourcecred is a reputation and contribution-tracking system that

G LO S SA RY

248

rewards community members based on their contributions to a
project. It assigns “cred” to individuals for their work, enabling
fairer recognition and compensation within decentralized communities.

Gnosis Multi-Signature
Wallet

The Gnosis multi-signature wallet (now Safe) is a secure asset
management tool that requires multiple approvals before executing transactions, providing decentralized control and enhanced
security.

Bonding Curves

Bonding Curves act as a funding and pricing mechanism by using
smart contracts to automatically adjust token prices based on
supply, allowing continuous minting, burning, and price discovery.

Revnets

Operates as an onchain cap table and incentive machine without
governance overhead. Acts like “digital vending machines,” issuing
$TOKENs when funds are provided. $TOKENs can be collateralized for loans, creating a flexible capital allocation system.

Ranked Choice Voting
(RCV)

Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is a voting system where voters
rank candidates by preference rather than choosing just one. If
no candidate wins a majority, the lowest-ranked candidates are
eliminated, and their votes are redistributed until one candidate
secures a majority, promoting more consensus-driven outcomes.

Base Paint - Pixel Artist
Revshare

A collaborative pixel art platform where artists contribute to
collective artwork and share generated revenue. Rewards are distributed based on contribution time and consistency, encouraging
ongoing participation and creativity.

Buidl Guidl Streams

BuidlGuidl Streams functions as a cooperative model by providing
Ethereum builders with a fully funded smart contract that allows
for flexible withdrawals based on their contributions.

Rotating Savings and
Credit Associations
(ROSCA)

Participants contribute to a collective savings pool, taking turns
to withdraw funds. This system provides a simple, interest-free
alternative to traditional banking, helping members fund major
expenses.

G LO S SA RY

Breadchain - Onchain
crowd staking mechanism

Decentralized funding model where participants receive tokens
representing their staked assets which grant them voting power
over how funds are distributed to community-driven projects.

Artizen (Artifacts)

Digital artifacts representing artistic contributions are tokenized.
Rewards are distributed to creators over time based on their
work’s sales and match funding, creating a sustainable ecosystem
for digital artists.

Pleasr - Time-Locked
Content Release

Content creators release digital works with time-locked contracts,
unlocking when predetermined milestones or funding levels are
reached. Rewards are distributed based on how early and consistently supporters back the project.

Hypercerts Impact
Certificates

Hypercerts are tokenized certificates that record contributions to
impact-driven projects using semi-fungible tokens. They enable
verification, auditing, and funding of impactful work.

Social Funding
Mechanism

Originating from the web3 social platform Farcaster, DEGEN
supports community signaling, reputation building, marketing, free
minting, voting, and project endorsement. It creates a dynamic
funding ecosystem by leveraging social media’s built-in engagement.
