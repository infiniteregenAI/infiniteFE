Earth. The domain of 7 . seo
the peculiar creatures
known as humans.

Humans are confronted with problerns
big and small that they can only solve
through coordinated efforts, Luckily,
they are social creatures.

Biologically drawn to each
other in friendship to live
and work together.

And they must! No one person knows it
all. No one person can handle the
challenges of the world on their own.
Humans have to collaborate in order to
meet those challenges and solve
problems head on.

When humans work
together, what they
can create is
astonishing.

But it’s not always easy...

As difficult as they may be to tackle,
challenges that occur within small
groups, like families and friends,
where everyone knows one another,
are the least complicated to solve.

There’s an established, mutual
reputation between small groups
of intimate people, so
coordination is easily negotiated.

As larger and larger groups of people
are required to address more cormplex
challenges, it’s just not possible for

everyone to know and trust each other.

Ignorance fuels doubt.
Doubt breeds fear. Fear
breeds more distrust,

and the cycle feeds itself.

realm as...

God of disorder,
distrust, isolation,
and discord.

Moloch makes its way
from cornmunity to
community, wherever
coordination is necessary.

When disaster strikes
Moloch is there, ready to
possess minds in these
afflicted communities.

Where such a need exists,
there is also oportunity for
coordination failures,

And the opportunity for
Moloch to seed doubt and
insecurity in the minds of
its victims,

Without tools to build
reputation and trust,
they believe Moloch.

How can they work. together when trust is
gone? If only there were tools that
guaranteed transparency and aligned
incentives towards the best outcome -
clean water.

During the mid 20th century, in a major
city, the water supply became too toxic to
drink, caused by corruption and negligence
at all levels, The community became
demoralized and stopped working together
to solve it.

Tools that proved work was being
done and resources properly
allocated. Without them corruption
reigned and people got sicker.

Special interests
fueled division and
they assumed more
power from the
people.

These community
members are
puppets of Moloch
now.

Despite its power, humanity has been
able to resist Moloch completely taking
over, but eventually, it returns.

Be it through naturally en é
occurring disasters like
plagues and hurricanes...

The same coordination breakthroughs
that defeat Moloch give rise to new
types of weaknesses it can exploit.

Or human-generated challenges
like pollution and corruption.

But little by little, with
each passing year,
human ingenuity and
its technology
continue to evolve...

ETHbot creates a tool that
lets supply chains organize
crop inventory.

It gives growers, shippers, and
marketplaces the ability to track
individual crops as they make
their way from soil to the store.
